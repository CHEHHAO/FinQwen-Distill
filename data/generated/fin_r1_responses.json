    "prompt": "Title: \"Opinion: Nation’s political left eagerly stokes outrage and anger\"\nText: \"Details are still emerging about the attempt to kill Donald Trump — about the shooter and how it was possible, and also what it says about America. The first is obvious: Political violence has no place in America. No matter our politics, Americans should never resort to violence to settle our differences. We may have many differences, but the only answer is speech, speech, and more speech. Except, those on the political left don’t believe that for a second, not after years of Big Tech censorship and other anti-speech activities. For eight years, leftist political leaders and cultural elites have done nothing but stoke outrage and anger, encouraging increased lawlessness and hate. Anti-Trumpism — “Orange Man Bad” — has become a religion with crazed, fanatical adherents. The “crying liberal” meme from January 2017 personified millions of people in this country. What happened in Butler, Pa. — with one victim dead and two critically injured — was not an isolated act. It didn’t just happen out of the blue, without rhyme or reason. It is the latest in a long list of examples of leftist violence meant to silence Republicans and tear apart America’s social fabric. The examples are endless. The 2020 “Black Lives Matter” riots across 140 cities ended up costing the economy billions of dollars, thousands of damaged businesses, and dozens of lost lives. Radical Antifa activists claimed entire neighborhoods in once-great cities like Portland and Seattle, declaring “autonomous zones” free of police intervention and other government oversight. And the Democrats in power refused to act, cheering them on. Then there are the pro-Hamas protests tearing apart colleges and universities, with rioters preaching antisemitism and promoting a terrorist group at the expense of law and order. Once again, left-wing administrators refused to act. Are we honestly surprised that a former president who has been called a Nazi, fascist and war criminal happened to be shot while giving a stump speech? Is it shocking that a man denounced as “evil” time and time again became target practice by someone who saw absolutely no consequences — and no small amount of glorification — for outrageously violent leftism? Of course not. If any good-faith actors are on the left, now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to hold radicals accountable for the political violence that has reached such a boiling point rather than encouraging and rewarding bad conduct. If the “temperature” is to drop, that clearly needs to start with the anti-Trump crowd. It’s the most basic lesson: If you punish bad action, you get less of it. If you don’t, you get more. And, if you reward it, you get way more. Consider the debacle on our southern border, with the Biden administration refusing to take illegal immigration seriously and states subsidizing illegals with more money than we spend on our homeless and veterans. When you don’t punish unlawful activity and go so far as to encourage it to win votes, you get millions of migrants coming to America with no checks and balances. Where is their incentive to stop? Related Articles Schools that punish disruptive protesters with expulsion don’t get more disruptive protesters. Rioters don’t riot where they will be shot. Conversely, when bad behavior is encouraged by radicals in faculty or other leadership positions, the bad guys tear down more to get their way. Today’s left has abandoned our most basic principles — personal responsibility, civil discourse and social tolerance — while ramping up the vitriol about “literal Hitler” and “words are violence” over today’s progressive mental disorder du jour. And so, we get more political violence. The temperature isn’t too hot in America; it’s too hot on the left. Until the left takes responsibility for that and stops coddling the mob, there will only be more and more political violence — until the next horrific event.\"",

(NASDAQ: CRNC) (“Cerence AI” or “the Company”), a global leader in AI for transportation, today announced that, in light of its current cash position and outlook for future cash generation, the Company entered into privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (the “Notes”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to repurchase approximately $27 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes from such holders at a cash repurchase price equal to 98.5% of their principal amount, together with the accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. The repurchase of the Notes at a price below par represents a strategic decision by the Company to utilize its cash reserves efficiently. The transaction will reduce interest expense, eliminate potential dilution from refinancing the Notes being repurchased, and lower leverage—intended to deliver a net positive outcome for shareholders. Assuming completion of the repurchase of the Notes, the Company currently plans to pay off the remaining $60.5 million of Notes upon maturity in June 2025 using cash on hand. “This repurchase not only highlights our confidence in Cerence AI’s future, but also demonstrates our commitment to driving shareholder value,” said Brian Krzanich, Chief Executive Officer of Cerence AI. “By repurchasing these Notes at a discount, we will be taking a proactive step to optimize our balance sheet and reduce interest expense. We believe that doing so will position the Company for continued success in fiscal year 2025 and beyond.” “Our ability to execute these actions reflects careful financial planning, strategic execution on our cost-reduction initiatives, and disciplined cash management,” said Tony Rodriquez, Chief Financial Officer of Cerence AI. “As we move through fiscal year 2025, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance and creating long-term value for our shareholders.” In addition, the Company intends to terminate its undrawn $50.0 million senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility, contingent upon completion of the repurchase of the Notes. As a result, the Company will save on ongoing commitment fees. First Quarter and Fiscal 2025 Guidance Cerence AI reaffirms its first quarter fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2025 guidance previously disclosed in conjunction with its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 and full year ending September 30, 2024 financial results on November 21, 2024.

    "prompt": "Title: \"Mario Draghi wants the EU to build global corporate champions like Airbus. Good luck on that\"\nText: \"Former Italian prime minister and economist Mario Draghi delivers a speech during a plenary session of the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, eastern France, on Sept. 17. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images In Europe, Airbus is a cherished corporate star, as it should be. When its predecessor company was launched in the 1970s, Europeans thought the passenger-jet venture was borderline insane, doomed to prove that Europe could never compete with the Americans in the aerospace market. At the time, Boeing BA-N had been in the game for more than half a century and Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas were pumping out planes, too. A fourth player? Forget it. It was a long burn for Airbus but perseverance paid off, big time – today, it is the global leader in commercial aviation. Since 2019, it has outpaced Boeing (Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas are long gone) in aircraft orders and deliveries. Its market value, at €106-billion ($160-billion), is a quarter greater than Boeing’s. Airbus is expanding and has assembly plants in Quebec and Alabama. Boeing, meanwhile, stumbles from crisis to crisis. The flip-side of the story is that Airbus is the global success story that proves to be the exception. The European Union doesn’t do global success stories nearly as well or as often as the Americans. The EU competitiveness report launched earlier this month by Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, says as much. In essence, he concludes that the EU, and its fulsome social-services model, could fail unless it smartens up and faces what he calls its “existential challenge.” Take this sobering paragraph: “Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, there is no EU company with a market capitalization of over €100-billion that has been set up from scratch in the last 50 years, while all six U.S. companies with a valuation above €1-trillion have been created in this period.” Not one of the top-10 tech companies, measured by market value, is European. Semi-conductor giant ASML ASMLF of the Netherlands, in 12th position, is the closest contender, yet its value is one-tenth of Apple’s AAPL-Q . To be sure, the EU produced some global success stories decades ago that spend fortunes on research and development, but they tend to be concentrated in the auto sector (Volkswagen VWAGY , Mercedes MBGAF , BMW BMWYY ) and those companies are not creating jobs any more. Their market values are relatively small, they are far more likely to close factories in the next decade than open them, and China has taken the lead in the electric-vehicle revolution. The German automakers risk becoming relics of the past. So what did Airbus do to soar to the top? The business marked a rare collaboration between European governments, mostly from Germany, France and Spain, to combine their aerospace interests into one company, make sure it was well financed and run by pushy executives with a clearly defined goal, that is, create a rival to Boeing. It worked. Airbus is an example of sustained and ambitious pan-European teamwork that overcame parochial national interests. That experiment is unlikely to be repeated in spite of Mr. Draghi’s urgings. His 400-page report called for common bonds to help finance investments worth €800-billion a year, the integration of capital markets, common energy infrastructure and the dilution of competition rules to allow certain strategic sectors, such as telecoms and defence, to consolidate and create transnational powerhouses. The chances of all this happening, or at least happening fast enough not to get buried by the Americans and the Chinese, is remote. The EU is not a single entity like America or China. Its 27 countries are rarely unified on any domestic, foreign, industrial or environmental issue. Hungary, which is pro-Russia and continues to import Russian gas, comes to mind; it is the big hole in the EU’s pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia stance. The common market is not as common as advertised – the regulations and bureaucratic hassles that companies must endure to expand their businesses across borders can be numbing. The debt-fearing Germans and Dutch oppose the sale of common bonds to finance grandiose projects, or any projects, beyond the €200-billion devoted to the pandemic recovery funds. If common bonds never materialize, EU-wide investment funding would have to come from the EU budget, which is wholly inadequate to help build the bloc as a competitive force in any field. The budget is worth only about 1 per cent of the EU’s economic output. What else? How about energy prices. The United States is an oil and natural gas powerhouse and energy-intensive industries thrive on cheap prices. The EU has mostly stopped importing cheap Russian oil and gas and has little domestic hydrocarbon production. Germany, incredibly, recently closed all its nuclear power stations. Add this all up and poor Mr. Draghi is dreaming if he thinks his competitive action plan will be taken seriously and actually implemented. It should be, of course, but the EU remains a collection of countries without a common vision. Another Airbus seems like an impossibility.\"",

    "prompt": "Title: \"Canada needs to overhaul the Temporary Foreign Worker program, not just tinker with it\"\nText: \"The federal government recently announced important changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker program , a program that allows Canadian employers to hire foreign nationals to fill labour shortages at low wages. As of Sept. 26, 2024 , the federal government will stop processing employer requests for temporary foreign workers in cities with an unemployment rate of six per cent or higher, with limited exceptions. The government will also limit employers’ hiring of temporary foreign workers to no more than 10 per cent of their total workforce, a limit that was in place before the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum duration of employment for workers hired through the low-wage stream will be reduced to one year from two years. Unfortunately, these changes still fall far short of the reforms needed to address the program’s deeper issues. A United Nations special rapporteur has described the program as a “ breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery ,” highlighting the urgent need for far more comprehensive reforms. Rise in temporary foreign workers The Temporary Foreign Worker program was established to provide a temporary solution to labour shortages , allowing employers to hire foreign workers on a temporary basis when Canadian workers can’t be found. The program was originally intended as a short-term solution, meant to supplement the domestic workforce rather than replace it. In recent years, however, an increasing number of employers have been hiring temporary foreign workers to fill vacant jobs in their organizations, even as unemployment rises in Canada . This significant increase suggests that employers are increasingly depending on foreign labour to fill positions that, in the past, might have been filled by Canadian workers. The rise in temporary foreign workers is particularly pronounced in certain sectors, and there has been a significant rise in the number of positions that have been approved for temporary foreign workers. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of temporary foreign workers more than doubled according to data from Employment and Social Development Canada , increasing from 108,988 in 2018 to just under 240,000 in 2023. For instance, the number of approvals for food counter attendants, kitchen helpers and related occupations rose by 4,802 per cent between 2018 and 2023. Similarly, approvals for administrative assistants rose by 1,063 per cent, while light duty cleaners saw a 1,414 per cent increase. These changes are expected to affect the retail, accommodation and food service sectors the most. An exploitive system Nothing is being done to change the exploitive system that gives employers steady access to low-wage, vulnerable migrant workers with precarious work and immigration status. Temporary foreign workers in this program are tied to their employers through closed work permits that only allow them to work for the employer who applied to bring them to Canada for the length of time specified. Typically, they must leave Canada when their temporary job ends. Quitting or finding another job is not an option, forcing workers to stay in jobs that are often exploitative. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology released a report in May recommending that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada stop issuing these closed work permits. These employment terms create conditions for wage theft, excessive work hours, limited breaks and physical abuse. These issues were highlighted in a final report from the UN’s special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery , Tomoya Obokata. The special rapporteur also called attention to little information provided to these workers on their rights and the lack of enforcement measures to deal with exploitative employers or labour brokers who charge workers exorbitant fees to arrange their paperwork and job in Canada, often leaving workers in debt. It’s clear temporary foreign workers are not a short-term solution for perceived labour shortages, but are instead an entrenched element of Canada’s changing workforce. These workers remain in precarious temporary work even after years of living and working in Canada without ever getting any closer to achieving permanent residency, not to mention Canadian citizenship. Good enough to work, good enough to stay There should be permanent residency and a path to citizenship for all workers entering Canada. As the United Food and Commercial Workers Union has put it , if a person is “good enough to work” in Canada, then they are certainly “good enough to stay.” However, few temporary foreign workers, especially in the Low Wage stream, become permanent Canadian citizens. Union membership and permanent residency remain the only real solutions to the exploitive working conditions and employment system for temporary foreign workers. The Canadian Labour Congress has been a vocal advocate for reform, calling on the government to take concrete steps to improve protections for workers in the low-wage Temporary Foreign Worker program. These steps include: Replacing the employer-specific work permits with open work permits; Providing permanent residency opportunities for low-wage workers; and Provide permanent residency opportunities for former low-wage workers who are undocumented. By creating pathways to permanent residency and citizenship, Canada can ensure these workers, who contribute so much to the economy, are treated with more dignity and respect. Rather than tinkering around the edges, the federal government needs to fundamentally overhaul the Temporary Foreign Worker program to end the exploitation of these workers.\"",

    "prompt": "Title: \"Asia shares rally on US inflation relief\"\nText: \"Asian shares have rallied after a benign reading on US inflation restored some hope for further policy easing next year, amid relief that Washington has averted a government shutdown. After the bonanza of recent central bank decisions, this week is much quieter with only the minutes of a few of those meetings due. There are no Federal Reserve speeches and US data is of secondary importance. Otherwise the themes were largely the same on Monday, with the dollar underpinned by a relatively strong economy and higher bond yields, which in turn is a burden for commodities and gold. It is also a headache for emerging market countries, which are having to intervene to stop their currencies from falling too far and stoking domestic inflation. For now, the afterglow from the US inflation report was enough to lift MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 per cent. Japan's Nikkei gained 0.7 per cent and South Korea firmed 0.9 per cent. S&P 500 futures added 0.3 per cent, while Nasdaq futures firmed 0.4 per cent. The S&P 500 fell almost 2 per cent last week and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent, though the latter is still up 30 per cent for the year. Analysts at BofA noted the S&P 500 was up 23 per cent for the year, but if the 12 largest companies were excluded the gain was only 8 per cent. They cautioned such extreme concentration was a vulnerability going into 2025. Wall Street had rallied on Friday when a key gauge of core US inflation printed lower than expected at 0.11 per cent, providing a partial antidote to the Fed's hawkishness earlier in the week. Fed funds futures rallied to imply a 53 per cent chance of a rate cut in March and 62 per cent for May, though they only have two quarter-point easings to 3.75-4.0 per cent priced in for all of 2025. A few months ago, the market had hoped rates would bottom around 3.0 per cent. The prospect of fewer cuts has combined with expectations of more debt-funding government spending to pressure bond markets, with 10-year yields surging almost 42 basis points in just two weeks for the biggest such increase since April 2022. \"The recent firming in core inflation has interacted with a rising threat of tariffs and immigration restrictions to temper the Fed's inflation optimism,\" noted JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli. \"Given our inflation and unemployment rate forecasts, we continue to look for 75bp of cuts next year with a hold in January and a quarterly cadence thereafter.\" In currency markets, the dollar index held near two-year highs at 107.970 having climbed 1.9 per cent for the month so far. The euro looked vulnerable at $1.0432 having again tested support around $1.0331 last week. The dollar was firm at 156.44, having gained 4.5 per cent so far in December, but faces more threats of Japanese intervention should it challenge the 160.00 barrier. The strong dollar combined with high bond yields to weigh on gold, which stood at $US2,624 ($A4,197) an ounce after slipping one per cent last week. The high dollar is also a burden for oil, already hampered by concerns over Chinese demand following dismal retail sales figures last week. Brent was up four cents at $US73.00 ($A116.76) a barrel, while US crude gained 12 cents to $US69.58 ($A111.29) per barrel.\"",

    "prompt": "Title: \"India’s self-employed: Bridging the insurance gap with tech-enabled solutions\"\nText: \"India is home to over 300 million self-employed individuals, accounting for nearly 50% of the workforce. This diverse group includes gig workers, small business owners, freelancers, and independent professionals like doctors, lawyers, and architects, among others. Self-employment is the largest source of employment in India, playing a crucial role in driving the economy. The government, through various initiatives, is focusing on fostering self-reliance. Despite their immense contributions, self-employed individuals face significant challenges in securing financial protection, particularly in accessing adequate term life insurance coverage. Challenges faced by the self-employed Unlike salaried employees who often benefit from employer-sponsored insurance plans or regular incomes, self-employed individuals encounter several hurdles in obtaining term life insurance. Key challenges include: : Many self-employed individuals experience fluctuating earnings. For instance, a store owner, lawyer, or small workshop operator may see varied monthly incomes based on business conditions. Similarly, chartered accountants (CAs) might earn significantly more during tax-filing seasons and less during off-peak months. Such irregularity complicates insurers’ ability to assess eligibility. : Life insurers typically rely on formal financial documents like salary slips or income tax returns to determine a person’s income stream. However, many self-employed individuals lack such documentation, making it difficult to secure coverage reflective of their actual earnings. : Irregular incomes lead insurers to question the premium-paying capacity or Human Life Value (HLV) of self-employed individuals. As a result, many face rejections or inadequate coverage offers. This exclusionary approach leaves a large portion of the population underinsured or uninsured, exposing families to financial risks in case of untimely deaths. The problem is especially acute for women in non-metro areas—73.5% of rural women and 43.2% of urban women are self-employed. Leveraging technology for better underwriting The insurance industry has been quick to adopt artificial intelligence and tech-driven solutions to address customer-centric challenges. To better serve the self-employed segment, insurers can integrate alternative data sources into their underwriting models. : Bank transaction records, GST filings, UPI payments, and other digital trails can replace traditional documentation like ITRs or salary slips. : Advanced AI models can evaluate diverse data points—spending habits, loan repayment history, and more—to create holistic risk profiles. Automating this process allows insurers to account for the unique income patterns of professions like lawyers, CAs, or gig workers. : Based on these personalized risk profiles, insurers can offer dynamic premium pricing that aligns with an individual’s income seasonality, fostering inclusivity. An inclusive insurance ecosystem Policymakers, insurers, and financial institutions must collaborate to prioritize the insurance needs of this underserved segment. Insurers need to move away from a one-size-fits-all model and embrace strategies that reflect the realities of India’s self-employed workforce. Life insurance, often considered a “push product,\" continues to see low penetration in India, hovering around 3%. Rigid systems risk alienating self-employed Indians who are increasingly seeking financial security. By adopting tech-enabled underwriting and tailored policies, insurers can contribute to IRDAI’s ambitious goal of achieving “Insurance for All by 2047.\" A robust, inclusive insurance ecosystem will not only enhance financial security for millions but also help build a more stable future for the nation.\"",

    "prompt": "Title: \"Officers To Get Allowances In Digital Rupee Wallets? Know All About RBI's Plan\"\nText: \"New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is taking a significant step to promote its central bank digital currency (CBDC) by piloting its use internally. In a recent decision, the RBI has opted to credit a portion of reimbursements for internet and data charges directly to the CBDC wallets of its officers. This initiative is part of a broader plan to encourage the adoption of retail digital currency and evaluate its practical usability. CBDC, often seen as a counter to cryptocurrencies, is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency issued by the central bank. Unlike conventional deposits held in bank accounts, CBDC represents a direct liability of the central bank. This distinction sets it apart from the usual banking framework, as CBDC does not generate interest for its holders. According to Economic Times report citing an internal RBI communication dated December 27, this initiative aims to scale up the retail pilot of the CBDC and familiarize officers with the use of digital wallets. A user manual has been distributed to guide officers on updating their wallets. The RBI launched its pilot program for retail digital currency, also known as the e-Rupee, in December 2022. Despite its potential, CBDC adoption among retail users has been sluggish. With widespread acceptance of UPI and mobile payment platforms like GPay, CBDC has yet to gain significant traction. Moreover, the absence of interest on digital wallets and the lack of active promotion by banks have further limited its appeal. According to Economic Times report citing the banker, \"People might be more open to using CBDC if they can link it with UPI or other payment apps for seamless transactions. However, the fact that wallet balances don’t earn interest and banks aren’t enthusiastic about promoting CBDC wallets could be deterrents.\" The RBI’s latest move comes shortly after the appointment of a new governor, signaling a renewed push for digital currency. While the RBI has not announced plans for expanding this reimbursement initiative, the success of the current experiment could pave the way for broader usage among employees. Globally, CBDC has sparked debates about its potential benefits and risks. Advocates highlight its ability to make cross-border fund transfers faster and cheaper. However, monetary authorities, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have raised concerns about its macroeconomic implications. Some key challenges include the risk of deposit withdrawals from banks during financial stress, difficulties in liquidity forecasting due to demand volatility, and potential disruptions to central banks’ monetary policy operations. Moreover, while CBDC could streamline cross-border payments, it might also lead to volatile capital flows and amplify financial shocks across markets.

    "prompt": "Title: \"All It Takes Is $2,500 Invested in Each of These 3 High-Yield Dow Dividend Stocks to Help Generate Over $300 in Passive Income Per Year\"\nText: \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has 30 industry-leading components that act as representatives of the U.S. economy. The index's rich history has made it a go-to destination for investors looking for quality names that can help them generate dividend income. Over time, the composition of the Dow has changed to reflect the growing influence of technology on the economy, which has helped the Dow produce impressive gains in recent years. But even stodgy Dow names like Coca-Cola , Home Depot , and McDonald's have been roaring higher in recent months and helped the index achieve a fresh all-time high on Oct. 11. Despite the Dow's track record, not every component has a high yield or has been a trustworthy dividend stock. Boeing 's slew of challenges pressured the company to suspend its dividend. Tech stocks like Microsoft , Apple , and Salesforce have yields under 1%, and Amazon doesn't pay dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , Dow (NYSE: DOW) , and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are three of the highest-yielding stocks in the index. Investing $2,500 into each stock produces an average yield of 4.2% and should generate at least $300 in passive income per year. Here's why all three dividend stocks are worth buying now. J&J has dealt with significant challenges over the last few years Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. The company has long been known as a stodgy passive-income powerhouse. But the last few years have been challenging, as reflected in its languishing stock price. J&J was a leader in COVID-19 vaccine developments, which was initially a boon for the company. But rapidly declining demand for the vaccine has been a drag on the company to the point where J&J now reports many of its results as \"excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine.\" Another challenge has been adjusting to the spinoff of J&J's consumer health business, which occurred in August 2023. Former J&J brands, such as Band-Aid and Tylenol, are now under the new entity Kenvue . The spinoff should help J&J be a faster-growing company by focusing on just two segments -- Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, it does remove some of the safe and stodgy parts of the business that made J&J a rock-solid dividend stock, no matter the economic cycle. Finally, J&J has been dealing with lawsuits that allege its talc-based products led to cancer development. J&J restructured and made a subsidiary called Red River Talc LLC, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sept. 20 to handle current and future claims. After a messy few years, J&J is finally ready to turn the corner. The business has been putting up solid results and growing at a rate that should support good, if not excellent, dividend raises going forward. J&J generates a ton of free cash flow that easily covers its dividend expense. And with a yield of 3.1%, J&J stands out compared to the S&P 500 dividend yield of just 1.2%. Dow is a coiled spring for economic growth Not to be confused with the \"Dow\" in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow makes chemicals used in plastics, seals, foams, gels, adhesives, resins, coatings, and more. The commodity chemical company has three key segments -- Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, and Performance Materials & Coatings. Dow's business model is capital intensive and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in global demand and supply. Dow has been hit hard by volume declines and lower margins. In the following chart, you can see that revenue and margins surged in 2021 and early 2022 but have fallen considerably since then. Similarly, the stock price has gone practically nowhere since the spinoff. Dow has blamed macroeconomic factors as a key reason for its weak results. However, low interest rates could greatly benefit many of the company's end markets. For example, lower mortgage interest rates could boost housing demand, which would help Dow's polyurethanes and construction chemicals business. Lower interest rates could also boost demand for durable goods. Overall, Dow is well positioned to see a sizable uptick in earnings next year. Analyst consensus estimates call for just $2.26 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2024 but $3.55 in 2025 EPS. Although Dow looks expensive based on trailing earnings, it would have a far more reasonable valuation if it delivers on expectations. Despite the volatility of Dow's performance, it has proven to be a reliable income stock spinning off from DowDuPont in 2019. Dow yields 5.2%, making it the second-highest yielding stock in the Dow Jones, behind only Verizon Communications . Dow hasn't raised its payout since the spinoff, but it has incorporated stock repurchases as part of its capital return program. The company's goal is to return 65% of earnings to shareholders through buybacks and dividends so it has enough dry powder to fund long-term investments in new production plans, low-carbon efforts, and more. Overall, Dow is a good value stock for income investors to consider now. A quality energy stock with a high yield Like Dow, Chevron can be a highly cyclical business whose results are heavily impacted by commodity prices. But Chevron has a strong balance sheet, a diversified upstream business that doesn't depend on one production region, a massive refining business, and a track record for raising its dividend no matter what oil prices are doing. In fact, Chevron has paid and raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Chevron yields 4.3%, which is the third-highest yield in the Dow Jones. The company's track record for dividend raises, paired with its high yield, makes it arguably the single best passive income play out of the 30 Dow components. Investors worried about declining oil prices can take solace in knowing that Chevron has a large margin for error in supporting its dividend. Chevron's capital expenditures and buybacks are near five-year highs. If oil prices tank, Chevron can simply pause buybacks and pull back on capital expenditures. Chevron didn't cut its dividend when oil prices crashed in 2020, so it stands to reason that it would take a prolonged downturn for the company even to consider reducing its payout. Chevron stands out as a balanced buy for investors looking for a safer way to invest in oil and gas and power their passive income stream. Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?

He met with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink in Beijing on Dec. 5 , and Goldman Sachs President and COO John E. Waldron on Dec. 4 , according to state media. That followed a meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on Nov. 21 , state media said. \"The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington.

With actions such as hosting Wall Street executives and imposing export controls on critical minerals, Beijing is keeping its options open, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, who is Maurice R.

Chinese financial media summarized He Lifeng's meetings with the U.S. executives as sending a signal on Beijing's willingness to open up the financial sector and attract long-term, foreign institutional investment .

    "prompt": "Title: \"SKF interim report Q3 2024: Solid margin and strong cash flow in weak markets\"\nText: \"GOTHENBURG, Sweden , Oct. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Q3 2024 Net sales: SEK 23,692 million (25,771) Organic growth: −4.4% (−0.6%), driven by lower market demand across most regions and industries. Adjusted operating profit: SEK 2,821 million (2,956). Continued strong price/mix contribution, driven by pricing actions and active portfolio management, as well as good cost control which largely offset the lower volumes and currency headwind. Adjusted operating margin: 11.9% (11.5%) Net cash flow from operations: SEK 3,576 million (3,435) Rickard Gustafson , President and CEO: \" We are pleased to report a continued solid margin development, representing a year-over-year improvement, despite declining volumes in the prevailing weak market environment and significant currency headwinds. We continue our strategic execution creating an even stronger SKF, with the initiated separation of our Automotive business as a key component.\" Solid margin and strong cash flow The weak market conditions prevailed globally during the third quarter, which also was reflected in multiple leading external macro indicators. Our organic sales declined by -4.4%, driven in particular by a weak demand in China and within Automotive, especially towards the end of the quarter. On the other hand, our sales in India and within Aerospace were solid. Our adjusted operating margin, on the other hand, improved year-over-year and came in just shy of 12%, another proof point of our ability to better adapt to volatile market conditions. Our cost management and robust price/mix actions have effectively offset lower sales volumes, a significant negative currency impact and ongoing regionalization of our manufacturing footprint. We continue to work hard on cost out activities to mitigate potential short-term impact on our cost efficiency from the current lower volume environment. Our ability to uphold solid earnings also contributed to a strong cash flow from operations of SEK 3.6 billion . Unlocking value by separating the Automotive business The announced initiated separation of our Automotive segment follows our strategy to create a separate Automotive business. There is a strong strategic rationale for the separation since Industrial and Automotive are two business segments with different business logics. By establishing two fit-for-purpose independent companies, we expect to unlock long-term value and to accelerate profitable growth in both businesses. Since the announcement of the separation in mid-September, we have kick-started the separation planning and formed a dedicated project organization with the aim of listing the Automotive business in the first half of 2026. We intend to host a Capital Markets Day in Q4 2025 to share more information on the ambitions for both our Industrial and Automotive businesses. Strategic portfolio management to build a stronger SKF We continue to actively work with our portfolio to create a more focused and resilient SKF. I'm pleased that we have signed a contract to divest our ring and seal operation in Hanover , USA , which is a non-strategic asset for our Aerospace business, representing annual sales of approximately SEK 700 million , for a total value of approximately SEK 2.3 billion. Aerospace will remain one of our largest customer industries, representing total annual sales of approximately SEK 6 billion , corresponding to 9% of industrial net sales after the divestment. We will continue to invest and strengthen our position in core Aerospace segments related to the aeroengine and aerostructure bearing offers to optimize our business potential. With our strategy and decentralized operating model being well implemented, we are now in a position to also gradually accelerate profitable growth through smaller bolt-on acquisitions. As an example, the announced acquisition of John Sample Group is margin accretive and further strengthens our lubrication offering and position in the expansive India and Southeast Asia region. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their contributions to achieving solid margin and strong cash flow, despite the weak demand environment, and a continued high pace in our strategic execution.

    "prompt": "Title: \"2 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in the Back Half of 2024 and Beyond\"\nText: \"Lululemon Athletica ( LULU -1.72% ) and Celsius Holdings ( CELH -2.75% ) are two consumer brands that have become wildly popular over the years. Both stocks have been on great runs the past several years, although both have had large sell-offs this year. Let's look at why these stocks have sold off and why they could both be poised to see major rebounds in the second half of this year and beyond. 1. Celsius Holdings Energy drink maker Celsius had been on a massive run the past five years, until about late May. Now the beverage stock suddenly finds its share price cut nearly in half from its all-time highs. The company's success stems from carving out an attractive niche in the energy drink market by appealing to customers with a less aggressive aesthetic: differentiated flavors such as Peach Vibe, no-sugar options in a high-sugar category, slimmed-down cans, and a toned-down marketing message. A distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, meanwhile, gained the company widespread distribution across retailers, especially in the important convenience store channel. However, after three consecutive years of 100% or more revenue growth, that growth has unsurprisingly begun to slow. The company is now essentially fully distributed in the U.S. First-quarter revenue growth of 37% was strong, but ultimately a huge deceleration from the 95% sales growth it was in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Nielsen data in tracked channels has shown growth continuing to slow week after week, down to 13% the last week of June, although the comparison was affected by the timing of the July 4 holiday. Despite its slowing growth in tracked channels, Celsius still has a number of opportunities in front of it that could help the stock rebound this year and beyond. International growth remains a big opportunity for the company. It's just barely scratching the service in terms of penetration, as it has just entered markets in the U.K. and Australia. It also has an opportunity for increasing items per store, better cooler placement, and growing in non-tracked channels. Trading at under 35 times 2025 earnings estimates and with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1 times, the stock looks attractively valued for a growth stock that still has a number of good opportunities ahead of it. If the company can expand internationally and gain a similar niche to what it has in the U.S., the stock should perform well over the long term. CELH PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. 2. Lululemon Athletica Lululemon's stock has had a difficult year, with shares down over 40% year to date. Investors have been nervous about increased competition from the likes of upstarts such as Alo and Vuori, as well as potential fashion shifts. Cautious commentary about the U.S. consumer in March when it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results, combined with its chief product officer leaving in May, only added fuel to the fire. Last quarter, the company saw flat U.S. same-store sales , but a 29% jump in international same-store sales led to a 7% overall increase in same-store sales and a 10% overall increase in revenue. International remains one of the biggest opportunities for Lululemon moving forward, and so far it appears the brand is resonating with international customers. However, the company also has the ability to reinvigorate growth in its North American markets through product innovation and category expansion. The brand appears to remain strong, and the potential of an improved U.S. consumer and strong back-to-school season could also bode well for growth. Early indications are that the back-to-school shopping season is off to a good start, with Adobe Analysts noting that Amazon saw its Prime Day revenue for kids' apparel soar 165%, while other back-to-school items like backpacks and school supplies were up 216%. Other data points from the National Federation of Retailers, including May containership volumes and strong June retail, also point to a strengthening retail environment. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 18 based on 2025 estimates, Lululemon is trading at one of the cheapest valuations in its history. LULU PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. Given its valuation, the opportunities in front of it, and the potential for a strong back-to-school shopping season, the apparel stock could be set up to see a strong rebound in the back half of this year and beyond.\"",
