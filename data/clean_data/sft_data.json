    "title": "220,000 mt of polysilicon and 101.5 GW of battery modules \"sudden brake\"",
    "text": "Since H2 2023, the PV market has experienced a sharp downturn, with the industry deeply mired in a capacity surplus and facing a wave of brutal eliminations. Against this backdrop, PV companies have had to reassess the market environment, rationally adjust their strategies, and slow down or even terminate investment projects lacking competitive advantages. According to Polaris statistics, since 2023, 47 PV projects have been announced as delayed or terminated. These projects span the entire industry chain, including polysilicon, wafers, solar cells, auxiliary materials, and power stations. Among them are projects involving 320,000 mt of polysilicon, 37 GW of wafers/slices/ingots, 101.5 GW of solar cells and modules, and over 850 million m2 of PV film. \"84 GW Solar Cell Projects Abruptly Halted\" Among the aforementioned projects, 12 PV projects have been terminated, primarily focusing on the TOPCon and HJT solar cell segments, with a total scale reaching 84 GW. Notably, since H2 2023, the PV industry has undergone an iteration wave from P-type to N-type technologies, with solar cells being the core battleground of this transition, experiencing the most dramatic changes. According to InfoLink data, by the end of 2024, TOPCon solar cell capacity is expected to reach approximately 920 GW, sufficient to meet most or even all market demand for the next five years. With new capacity already ample and even approaching surplus, an intense \"price war\" has become inevitable, and TOPCon module prices are quickly aligning with P-type prices. For investing companies, this significantly compresses profit margins compared to initial investment expectations, leaving many in a dilemma. As \"cut-throat competition\" in the industry intensifies, an increasing number of cross-sector entrants are exiting this brutal competition. Companies like Lingda Co., Meditech, and Haiyuan Composite Materials have successively pressed the termination button. Even Sunflower, which had re-entered the PV field with high confidence, terminated its 10 GW TOPCon solar cell project under the severe circumstances. Similarly, East China Heavy Machinery took only a year to go from deciding to invest 6 billion yuan in a high-profile cross-sector PV venture to terminating its 10 GW N-type solar cell project. Shanxi Coal International Energy Group, one of the earliest publicly listed firms to venture into HJT, also succumbed, ultimately announcing the termination of its 3 GW HJT solar cell project. Beyond the solar cell segment, PV backsheet leader Zhonglai Co. terminated its 100,000 mt high-purity polycrystalline silicon project; inverter company Xinyuan Technology terminated its 20 GW inverter and bidirectional converter project, while Deye Co. announced the termination of its 1.5 billion yuan inverter investment project. Additionally, Meditech, whose performance was dragged down, announced the termination of its 9 GW high-efficiency monocrystalline solar cell smart factory project and began divesting PV assets. Jiaojian Co., after reassessing market risks, decided to terminate its plan to acquire a 70% stake in Boda New Energy. 35 PV Projects Delayed Amid this overwhelming \"PV winter,\" for ongoing projects, blind expansion would only plunge companies deeper into financial crises, making project delays a rational choice after careful consideration. According to incomplete statistics, 35 PV projects have been announced as delayed in 2024, covering the entire industry chain from polysilicon, wafers, solar cells and modules, auxiliary materials, to power stations. Although some project completion timelines have been pushed to 2025 or even 2026, this move also reflects a glimmer of hope among companies for a market recovery in the future. Among these, Daqo New Energy's 100,000 mt polysilicon investment and Saineng Silicon's 100,000 mt granular silicon Phase I 20,000 mt project have been delayed; Jingyuntong's Leshan 22 GW ingot and slicing project has been postponed to the end of 2024 for commissioning; and solar cell and module projects totaling 46.5 GW, invested by companies like Dechen New Energy and Eging PV, have been delayed by over six months. In the auxiliary material segment, delays in PV film projects are relatively concentrated. \"Main players\" such as First, Crown, Tianyang New Materials, and Lushan New Materials have successively postponed their project investments by over a year, with each project scale ranging from 150-250 million m2. On the equipment side, equipment companies like Shichuang Energy, Tiantong Co., Autowell, and Micro Guide Nano have delayed their projects by at least a year. Among them, Autowell's TOPCon solar cell equipment project has been postponed to August 2026; Tiantong Co. has delayed the \"large-size RF piezoelectric wafer project\" and the \"new-type high-efficiency crystal growth and precision processing intelligent equipment project\" to December 2026 for reaching their intended usable state. Shichuang Energy has postponed the intended usable state timelines for its high-efficiency solar cell equipment expansion project, new material expansion and automation upgrade project, and R&D center and information construction project by 1-2 years. Micro Guide Nano has delayed the intended usable state timeline for its \"PV and flexible electronics equipment expansion and upgrade project based on atomic layer deposition technology\" to December 2025. Notably, as downstream end-user PV power stations, project delays have started to increase. This year, as distributed PV installation scales continuously set new records, the associated investment risks have also grown. The implementation of time-of-use electricity prices and distributed PV market trading policies have introduced fluctuations in electricity price returns, making investments increasingly cautious. For instance, distributed PV projects invested by companies like Shanghai Nenghui, Xinneng Technology, GCL Energy Technology, and Ainuo Energy, spanning multiple provinces and cities, have seen significant delays in overall project progress due to policy impacts and adjustments in resource planning by owners. Additionally, changes in the nature of PV land use have also become a reason for implementation delays. Jinkai New Energy announced that due to changes in land use nature, the 100 MW fishery-PV hybrid project in Huangxiekou, Jianli City, and the 200 MWp agrivoltaic-storage hybrid project in Gangnanqiaoxu Town, Guigang City, had to be postponed to June 2025.

    "title": "Google: The AI Bears Are Wrong",
    "text": "igoriss Alphabet Inc ( NASDAQ: GOOG ) ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) ( NEOE: GOOG:CA ) has been getting bearish coverage from analysts due to its perceived weakness in generative artificial intelligence (“AI”). Most recently, Rosenblatt analyst Bruce Crockett downgraded the stock due to the “ transitionally negative ” revenue impact of AI overviews. Shortly before that, downgrades were observed at Wedbush , Seeking Alpha Quant , and elsewhere. In addition to the “transitionally negative revenue impact,” Crockett also touched on search share loss to Microsoft's ( MSFT ) Bing, and advertising share loss to retail media networks. Although most analysts are presently bullish on Google, the views expressed in Crockett’s note are not uncommon. Namely, that the stock is good going by historical financials, but that its competitive position is deteriorating in a way that will prevent such numbers from being repeated in the future. Such views have some merit to them; for example, Google’s Search Market share has, in fact, been declining over time (albeit at a very slow pace). Google Search Market Share (Statista) Also, concerns about a negative revenue impact from AI aren't unwarranted. If you consider Crockett's claim that AI overviews will cost Alphabet some revenue temporarily, you'll see that it has some merit. The way Google’s AI overviews work now is these overviews are displayed where ads traditionally were (right beneath the search bar) , which means that they compete with ads for screen real estate. So the overviews might, in fact, result in fewer ads being clicked, and lesser revenue. Google AI overview (Google) The above are valid reasons to think that Alphabet stock is due for a correction. The stock’s valuation is historically high, scoring an ‘F’ in Seeking Alpha Quant . Furthermore, the company faces competitive threats that it didn’t face in years past. All of these factors suggest that Google’s core search business could suffer shrinking margins in the years ahead. However, there are other reasons to think that Google will thrive in the years ahead. The company is an AI leader, it owns YouTube and the Play store, and its cloud services business is one of the world’s fastest growing. Although the majority of the company’s revenue has historically come from search, that needn’t be the case forever. Other segments are growing more rapidly; some of them are growing as rapidly as true growth companies. These segments could provide the fuel needed for more gains going forward. Accordingly, I consider Google stock a great value today, despite all of the risks it faces. When I last covered Google , I rated the stock a buy for reasons similar to those outlined above: it was relatively cheap for a big tech company, had a strong competitive position as well as high growth. Those reasons still stand. However, having used some of Google’s newer AI tools myself, I now believe that Google is more an opportunity for Google than a risk in the long run. Accordingly, I am upgrading my rating to ‘strong buy.’ Google’s AI Opportunity One of the main criticisms of Google in the Rosenblatt note mentioned at the beginning of this article is the fact that AI overviews will reduce Search revenue in the near term. This is probably correct, as the image below illustrates. On the left are two of the new AI-powered search results, and on the right are traditional results. In the AI-powered search results, the AI overviews crowd out screen real estate that would normally be reserved for showing ads. As you can see, the “traditional” search results have ads immediately below the search bar and “ above the fold .” The AI-powered search, on the other hand, features AI overviews and their sources, with no ads visible “above the fold.” AI Google vs Old Google (Google, with annotations by the author) Despite the fact that AI search overviews are crowding out ads presently, it appears likely that such overviews will be a positive rather than a negative for shareholders in the long run. First, as Microsoft showed with Bing , it is possible to embed ads within AI-written content. Second, Google is more than just search. Although Search is 57% of Google’s revenue mix, the percentage has been trending downward over time. YouTube ads grew at 60% and the Cloud grew at 28% last quarter, while Search grew at 15% year-over-year. These facts imply that YouTube and the Cloud are going to be a bigger percentage of Google in the future than they are today. Third, a “temporary headwind to revenue” is not the same thing as an existential threat. If stocks are valued as the discounted value of their cash flows over their entire lifetimes, then temporary revenue headwinds are not fatal. A single quarter of $0 profit does not much change the value of a multi decades-lasting cash flow starting at a billion dollars per year, compared to if the profit track record were uninterrupted. Fourth and finally, AI is overall more of a tailwind for Google than a headwind. Google is one of the world’ leading artificial intelligence (“AI”) companies. Having invented the transformer method that made ChatGPT such a smash hit, it was pivotal in the development of modern AI. This heritage means that AI has deep roots at Google. To be sure, Google has attracted some criticism for how it has handled consumer-facing AI. This year, some of Gemini's output featured egregiously incorrect depictions of people and things. When examples of such output were posted to social media, they generated a firestorm of controversy, ultimately culminating in Google apologizing for Gemini’s errors. Such concerns have been with us for a while. When ChatGPT first launched, commenters speculated that it would “kill” Google Search. Later, when it turned out that ChatGPT didn’t kill Google search, the company again found itself embroiled in controversy when its own chatbot delivered inaccurate results . It all looked pretty grim for Google for a while. More recently, things turned around. First, the company announced AI enhancements for search, which included AI-powered search summaries. These were well received–much better than Gemini was. Second, the company put out a series of good earnings releases, such as its first quarter 2024 release, which easily surpassed analyst expectations. These two factors came together to massively improve sentiment toward Google, which has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. Despite Gemini’s lukewarm reception, Google is one of the best positioned companies in the AI arms race. It has seven products with over a billion users each; a massive captive audience to push its AI offerings to. It has many capable AI engineers. It has a number of AI patents that can be used to protect its moat. So, Google has many cards up its sleeve. How Google will Make Money With AI There are several ways for Google to make money with AI, including: Continuance of what it’s already been doing. Google is already realizing efficiency gains by incorporating AI into YouTube. One way YouTube uses AI is in content moderation. Google’s AI can identify violating content with surprisingly high accuracy and take it down. In 2023, Google cut costs aggressively , largely in YouTube content moderation teams. There was no apparent hit to revenue. In fact, revenue increased in the first quarter of 2024. The fact that efficiency improved after the spending cut is a testament to the efficiency boosting power of AI. Similar gains may be seen in other areas of Google’s business after AI is better integrated into them. Selling AI servers. Google is already offering access to NVIDIA-based servers as a selling point to Google Cloud users. Google Cloud is a revenue generating, EBIT-profitable business unit, and a powerful use case like this one could drive revenue growth, possibly even acceleration. Better integrating AI into search. Although Rosenblatt called AI overviews a “temporary headwind” to Google Search, the same feature could also drive revenue in the future, namely through embedded ads. They could also help retain users if implemented well. So, a good implementation of Search AI could help shore up Google’s competitive position. Valuation Using the following assumptions, I built a simple discounted cash flow model for Google: The next five year’s revenue growth rate will be 10% CAGR, as Google’s scale will probably bring some deceleration from the previous 10-year rate ( 18.56% ). COGs will increase at the same pace as revenue. Operating expenses, which grew at 13.6% CAGR over the last 10 years, will decelerate to 10% growth in the next five years thanks to AI efficiency gains. Net interest expense will remain near $3.8 billion, as the company does not have a pressing need to borrow money. The share count will continue declining at 0.85% per year, which is the historical rate. Taxes will be 15% of EBT. These assumptions yielded the model below: TTM Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 REV 318146 349960.6 384956.6 423452.3 465797.5 512377.3 COGS 135319 148850.9 163735.9 180109.5 198120.5 217932.6 OPERATING COSTS 85828 94410.8 103851.8 114237 125660.7 138226.8 INTEREST 3807 3807 3807 3807 3807 3807 EBT 93192 102891.9 113561.7 125298.7 138209.2 152410.8 NET INCOME 13979 15433.7 17034.2 18794.8 20731.3 22861.6 TAX 79213 87458.1 96527.5 106503.8 117477.8 129549.2 SHARES OUTSTANDING 12648 12540.5 12433.8 12328.2 12223.0 12119.5 EPS $6.26 $6.9 $7.7 $8.6 $9.6 $10.6 Click to enlarge Note that the TTM figures differ from the actuals because this model ignores currency fluctuations, to keep everything understandable. Basically, what we’ve got here is EPS growing from $6.25 to $10.69 in five years. This is an 11.3% CAGR growth rate. The cash flows, discounted at 8%, are worth $34.31. If the cash flows grow for one more year at 11.3% before levelling off to a 5% steady state growth rate, then we get a “terminal year cash flow” of $11.89. The value of that cash flow in year 5 is $396. The present value of the terminal value is $223. Adding the discrete forecast plus the terminal value together gives an approximate $258 fair value estimate. That’s 41% upside to today’s price. So, Google appears to be worth the investment. Conclusion Is Google’s AI implementation going to cause the company to experience near-term revenue weakness? It’s possible, but not a foregone conclusion. AI overviews taking up valuable screen real estate certainly reduces search ad load, but Google has so many businesses that slight weakness in search could be made up for elsewhere in the business. If we assume only moderate top line growth and reasonable cost discipline, then GOOG stock is worth the investment. So, I plan to continue holding.

    "title": "Cerence Announces Repurchase of $27 Million of 3% Senior Notes Due 2025",
    "text": "BURLINGTON, Mass., Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cerence Inc. (NASDAQ: CRNC) (“Cerence AI” or “the Company”), a global leader in AI for transportation, today announced that, in light of its current cash position and outlook for future cash generation, the Company entered into privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (the “Notes”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to repurchase approximately $27 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes from such holders at a cash repurchase price equal to 98.5% of their principal amount, together with the accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase. The repurchase of the Notes at a price below par represents a strategic decision by the Company to utilize its cash reserves efficiently. The transaction will reduce interest expense, eliminate potential dilution from refinancing the Notes being repurchased, and lower leverage—intended to deliver a net positive outcome for shareholders. Assuming completion of the repurchase of the Notes, the Company currently plans to pay off the remaining $60.5 million of Notes upon maturity in June 2025 using cash on hand. “This repurchase not only highlights our confidence in Cerence AI’s future, but also demonstrates our commitment to driving shareholder value,” said Brian Krzanich, Chief Executive Officer of Cerence AI. “By repurchasing these Notes at a discount, we will be taking a proactive step to optimize our balance sheet and reduce interest expense. We believe that doing so will position the Company for continued success in fiscal year 2025 and beyond.” “Our ability to execute these actions reflects careful financial planning, strategic execution on our cost-reduction initiatives, and disciplined cash management,” said Tony Rodriquez, Chief Financial Officer of Cerence AI. “As we move through fiscal year 2025, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance and creating long-term value for our shareholders.” In addition, the Company intends to terminate its undrawn $50.0 million senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility, contingent upon completion of the repurchase of the Notes. As a result, the Company will save on ongoing commitment fees. First Quarter and Fiscal 2025 Guidance Cerence AI reaffirms its first quarter fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2025 guidance previously disclosed in conjunction with its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 and full year ending September 30, 2024 financial results on November 21, 2024. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, nor shall there be any offer or sale of our securities in any state or jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

    "title": "Scotiabank economist warns Trump win would bring 'ruinous' policies",
    "text": "A second presidential term for would likely bring about extreme protectionism, a large negative population shock and a surge of debt issuance to fund “totally undisciplined fiscal policy,” a top Canadian economist warned. The Republican candidate’s proposed policies and “likely debasement of democratic and market institutions would be ruinous to the U.S. and global economies,” Derek Holt, ’s head of capital markets economics, said in a note to investors. “The U.S. economy doesn’t need pump-priming, it’s in excess demand and will remain there next year, and Trump’s plans risk being highly destabilizing to world markets in a much more fractured world,” Holt wrote. “The U.S. needs to assert control over its borders, but Trump’s extreme immigration policies would severely damage the U.S. economy.” Holt added: “America’s fiscal position is living on borrowed time and the more damage that’s done now, the higher taxes will go in future in a potentially more divided and more dangerous world.” An analysis by Bloomberg Economics last month estimated that U.S. debt may rise to 116 per cent of under Trump’s tax-cut plan, from 99 per cent currently. Under Harris’s platform, it would be on a path to 109 per cent. It’s unusual for a Canadian bank economist to write about U.S. politics using such stark language. Canada ships about three-quarters of its exports to its southern neighbour, and is also a huge importer of goods and services from the U.S. In fact, Canada is the largest export destination for 34 U.S. states, according to calculations by economist Trevor Tombe using U.S. government data. As such, it has plenty at stake in the direction of U.S. trade and foreign policy. Holt said his note isn’t an endorsement of who was one of the few U.S. senators to vote against the revised U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement in 2020. Democrats have made major errors during the Biden administration, including on immigration, the Scotiabank economist said. “It’s a matter of picking the one you think will be less damaging,” Hold said. “As a professional economist, I have no doubt that this means voting against Donald Trump and the weak self-serving men behind him.” Trump’s “clear preference toward allowing Russia to have its way with Ukraine, and China with Taiwan,” would be the biggest foreign policy mistakes since the appeasement of Germany in the late 1930s, Holt wrote. “There are those in my industry who I know will scoff at this,” the economist said. “They will put self-interest above the nation’s and the world’s interests.”",

    "title": "Experts ask RBI to cut interest rate to revive real estate market, ease home loan burden",
    "text": "With the Reserve Bank of India keeping its key interest rate unchanged, real estate experts and developers have stressed the need to lower the rate, citing the need to stimulate sluggish sales and ease the growing burden of borrowing costs. “At this point, a rate cut would be more beneficial for consumers,\" said Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of real estate consultant Knight Frank India. “Growth in home loans has slowed and consumption among lower-income groups has significantly decreased, as witnessed in the sharp moderation in sales of affordable housing.\" “Industry concerns regarding affordable housing are sounding a loud alarm. A long-overdue rate cut is deemed essential to sustain steady economic and real estate growth, imperative for maintaining India's fastest-growing GDP status,\" said Niranjan Hiranandani, a Mumbai-based developer and chairman of the National Real Estate Development Council. The RBI kept its key repo rate unchanged at 6.5% on Friday to check inflation and cut its estimate for GDP growth in FY25 to 6.6% from 7.2%. However, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee slashed the cash reserve ratio by 50 basis points to 4%, reducing the amount of reserves that banks have to maintain with the central bank. Housing sales declined in the July-September quarter as prices increased. Residential sales fell 11% from a year earlier and new launches dropped 19%, according to ANAROCK Research. Sales in the affordable segment – homes costing less than 50 lakh – declined 14% to 20,769 units in the third quarter of 2024 from 23,026 units in the same period a year ago, according to data from Knight Frank Research. The combined impact of rising prices, high home loan rates, and the persistent adverse effects of the pandemic in the real estate sector have suppressed demand. However, sales in the high-end segment – homes costing more than 1 crore – climbed 41% to 40,328 units in Q3 and have been the primary driver of the overall sales growth in the sector. High interest rates make home loans expensive, and borrowers face challenges such as higher monthly loan repayments or longer loan tenures. , the largest private lender, charges interest of 9.4% to 9.95% for standard housing loans. State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, charges 8.5% to 9.65% and ICICI Bank levies interest in the range of 9.25% to 10.05%, reported in August. “Affordability has become challenging as loans remain expensive and property prices have steadily increased,\" said Kanika Singh, chief risk officer at India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation. “Residential real estate sales have moderated, with high-end, mid-end, and affordable segments largely flat over the last quarter. Factors such as high capital values, inflation pressures, and uncertainty around the RBI's repo rate cut may lead some homebuyers, especially in metros, to adopt a wait-and-watch approach. Meanwhile, tier 2 and 3 cities continue to drive growth in housing loans.\" IMGC is a joint venture of International Finance Corporation, ADB Bank, Genworth USA, Brookfield-owned Sagen, and the National Housing Bank. “A rate cut could have boosted the real estate sector, particularly amidst slowing demand and moderation in wage growth,\" said Dhruv Agarwala, group CEO of Housing.com and Proptiger.com. “However, housing demand remains strong, especially in the high-end and luxury segments, with most new launches in the December quarter targeting these categories.\" The lowering of the CRR by the RBI is aimed at increasing liquidity, which is expected to tighten in the months ahead due to tax outflows, increase in currency in circulation and volatility in capital flows. \"The cut in CRR by the RBI today will shore up liquidity in the economy and help developers borrow more as there is an unlimited requirement for funds in this sector,\" said Samir Jasuja, founder of PropEquity. “However, a cut in the repo rate would have given a fillip to consumption and helped boost housing demand.\" He added that in order to achieve a $1 trillion real estate economy, radical reforms have to be made, including making home loans both accessible and affordable to tap the high demand for housing. According to Raoul Kapoor, co-CEO of Andromeda Sales and Distribution, a loan distributor, the CRR cut is expected to result in lower lending rates, making home and personal loans more affordable for borrowers. “Reduced borrowing costs can lighten equated monthly installments (EMIs), encourage credit uptake, and stimulate sectors such as housing and small businesses, thereby supporting economic growth while easing financial burdens on borrowers,\" Kapoor said. Hiranandani had expected a rate cut, citing ‘supply-side’ constraints for accelerating inflation, and said the RBI’s decision raises significant concerns about India's economic growth trajectory. “Though monetary policy influences demand, it is supply-side factors that substantially drive food inflation,\" Hiranandani said. “A strategic reduction in interest rates could have stimulated sustainable GDP growth while addressing inflation through supply-side measures.\" “The reduction in the existing repo rate would have been a great push for fence sitters planning to take loans anticipating lower EMIs,\" said Sandeep Chhillar, founder and chairman of the Landmark Group, a real estate company based in Gurugram. “The general expectation was for a rate cut of at least 25 basis points,\" said Piyush Bothra, co-founder and CFO of Square Yards, an integrated platform for real estate and mortgages. However, the decision to reduce the credit reserve ratio by 50 basis points is expected to help increase liquidity in the banking system and boost overall credit disbursements.\" Others see the status quo as positive but expect to see a rate cut in the near future. \"The apex bank’s decision... reflects a balanced and prudent approach to sustaining economic stability while fostering growth,\" said Pradeep Aggarwal, founder and chairman of Global (India) Ltd. “However, a rate cut in the future could infuse much-needed liquidity into the real estate sector, accelerating growth and enhancing accessibility for buyers.\" “The real estate sector stands to benefit from continued stability. For developers, this means sustained demand for residential properties,\" said Madhur Gupta, CEO of Hero Realty. “Lower GDP growth may indicate weaker overall demand, but on the other hand, stability in interest rates coupled with improved liquidity could continue to drive demand in the mid- and luxury housing segments, which have been rising due to growing middle-class aspirations and increasing housing requirements,\" said Sharad , founder and CEO of Arnya RealEstates Fund Advisors. “Should the RBI decide to cut rates in the future, it could further spur residential real estate demand, making home ownership more affordable and attractive for buyers.\"",

    "title": "7 tips to prepare for next year’s taxes now",
    "text": "By Kemberley Washington, CPA, Bankrate.com (TNS) As the end of the year approaches, now’s the time to start preparing for filing your 2024 tax return in 2025. When it comes to tax strategies, generally Dec. 31 is the deadline to make changes that might lower your tax bill. One major exception is the deadline for contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA : You have until April 15, 2025, to make a contribution to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax year 2024. If you qualify for deductible IRA contributions , then a contribution to your traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income for 2024. Here are tips and strategies to prepare now for the 2025 tax-filing deadline. If you had significant changes in your life in 2024 — maybe you got married or divorced, started your own business, or had to claim unemployment benefits — your taxes may be more complicated. As a result, you might need to hire a certified public accountant (CPA), enrolled agent (EA) or other tax professional to prepare and file your taxes. If you decide to hire someone, it’s best to start planning for that sooner rather than later. Waiting until the calendar flips to April could cost you. The average fee for a professional to prepare and file a simple Form 1040 tax return, with no itemized deductions, is about $220, according to a survey by the National Society of Accountants in 2020-2021, the most recent data available. But that amount rises quickly for more complex returns, and varies depending on where you live. For example, a Form 1040 with itemized deductions costs an average of $432 in states on the Pacific Coast, compared with $285 in New England. No matter where you live, prices usually rise as the tax deadline approaches, so it’s smart to start searching for a tax pro soon. If you’re uncomfortable doing your taxes on your own and can’t afford a CPA, enrolled agent or other tax pro, or to pay for tax software , there are free options to consider. The IRS currently offers three ways to prepare your taxes for free: •With the IRS Free File program, the IRS partners with for-profit tax-software companies that offer free tax-prep software to eligible taxpayers so they can file their federal tax returns for free. Some taxpayers may also qualify for a free state tax filing, depending on the software provider. In January, the IRS will announce the income limit to qualify for the program for the 2025 tax season (for filing 2024 tax returns). For the 2024 tax season (2023 tax returns), taxpayers’ adjusted gross income (AGI) couldn’t exceed $79,000. •The IRS also offers its Direct File program, a free tool that allows you to file your federal income tax return directly with the IRS at no cost. The program supports simple tax returns and is available only in certain states. Check to see if you qualify here. •Another free-filing option is the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. IRS-certified volunteers offer free basic tax preparation in person to people who earn less than $67,000 a year, are disabled or whose English is limited. The IRS has an online location tool for hundreds of free tax preparation sites in the U.S. (the locator tool is updated from February through April). Some VITA sites also offer online tax-prep assistance. Now is a good time to create an IRS online account. If you want to see your Form 1040 from last year, or you’re missing a prior year Form W-2 or mortgage interest statement, you can find your documents using this free tax tool. Another benefit of creating an IRS online account is that it allows you to quickly obtain your prior year’s tax information without sitting on the phone for hours with an IRS representative, says Carl Johnson, a certified public accountant in New Orleans. An IRS online account also lets you view your account balance and payment history for each year. You can also create a payment plan to settle your federal income tax debt within minutes. If you’re 73 years old and have enjoyed watching your 401(k) or IRA grow tax-free without touching it, remember that the IRS is going to want its share each year. That means you’ll have to make withdrawals — and pay income tax. If you turned 73 in 2024, plan to take your required minimum distribution (RMD) at the latest by April 1, 2025. Read this IRS bulletin for more information. The amount of your RMDs is based on your age and the year-end values of your retirement accounts. A Roth IRA has two big tax advantages over a traditional IRA : Qualified withdrawals are not considered income for federal (and usually state) tax purposes, and you don’t have to take distributions from a Roth every year once you reach age 73. Converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may save you money in the long run. Just know that when you convert an IRA to a Roth, it’s considered taxable income, which will raise your tax bill for that year. Generally, it’s best to convert to a Roth IRA when you’re in a low-income year. As tax season approaches, many people start receiving phone calls, emails and texts from entities claiming to be the IRS. Be wary, and understand that these are scams. Typically, the IRS will mail you a notice before using any other method of communication to notify you concerning issues with your tax return. The IRS won’t reach out via social media or text messaging. Relatedly, the IRS warns taxpayers to be careful when choosing a tax preparer. Taking time to vet your tax preparer is crucial to protect yourself from tax scams and fraud. Before hiring a tax professional, search that person’s name in the IRS database of federal tax return preparers to avoid dishonest “professionals.” “Taxpayers should check the tax professional’s credentials,” Johnson says. Tax pros without credentials “may take questionable positions without any degree of scrutiny or fear of losing their access to the profession,” Johnson says. Taxpayers who don’t file a tax return and owe a tax bill, or who file but don’t pay their tax bill on time, risk severe penalties. The IRS can even seize assets if necessary. Respond quickly if the IRS has been sending you letters because it found an error on your return or claims you owe back taxes. Typically, the IRS will send you a notice if you have a balance due, changes were made to your tax return, or the agency needs additional information. “If you ignore a collection letter from the IRS, you may face wage garnishments, liens, bank levies, and other adverse action. And in some cases, the amount due may increase for failure to respond,” Johnson says. Keep in mind the IRS does offer installment plans and other payment plans. Make copies of your correspondence and use only the U.S. Postal Service, the postmark from which is your proof of timeliness when responding. But whatever you do, don’t ignore the IRS because this may cause more issues in the future. ©2024 Bankrate.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Nordstrom family will take retailer private in US$4B deal",
    "text": "The Nordstrom family teamed up with Mexican retailer Liverpool to clinch a US$4 billion deal to take iconic department store chain Nordstrom private, six years after a similar attempt fell short. Nordstrom and rivals such as Macy's have become enticing takeover targets in recent years as sales have slowed and shares have slumped. The Nordstrom family has wanted to take the company private in part because it believes it is undervalued in the public markets after a 70 per cent tumble since 2015, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before Monday's trading, the company had a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.20, far below the industry median of 20.5, according to data compiled by LSEG. Its operating margins over the past three years have averaged 3.7 per cent, less than the peer median. The deal, announced Monday at a value of $24.25 a share, will give the Nordstrom family majority ownership and a chance to strengthen the company's fortunes without having to report financials to public shareholders. Nordstrom had rebuffed an offer from the family back in 2018 worth $8.4 billion, far more than the latest bid. Talk of a deal re-emerged in March, when Reuters exclusively reported the family was making another attempt at taking the company private. Nordstrom's shares were down 1.6 per cent on Monday. Department stores have struggled to increase sales in the past few years as shoppers cut spending due to higher inflation, and as they shifted to off-price chains such as TJX. E-commerce giants such as Amazon.com have also steadily grown market share, adding to the competition. Higher input costs and supply-chain snags following the COVID-19 pandemic have also pressured the company. In September, the family and El Puerto de Liverpool offered $23 a share for the 56 per cent of Nordstrom they did not already own. A team-up with the Mexican retailer should reassure shareholders about the decisions the company makes going forward, emarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian said. The acquisition, which was cleared by a special committee, gives majority ownership to the family, led by current CEO Erik Nordstrom and President Pete Nordstrom, the great-grandchildren of John Nordstrom, who founded the company in 1901. The deal has an enterprise value of $6.25 billion, including debt, and will be partly funded through $450 million in borrowings under a new $1.2 billion asset-based bank financing. It is expected to close in the first half of 2025, the company said. \"Given the board's approval and lack of any (apparent) opposition, I believe that the deal will go through at the proposed price,\" said Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Morgan Stanley & Co and Centerview Partners are acting as financial advisers to the special committee, and Moelis & Company is acting as financial adviser to the Nordstrom family. The sector has been a locus of deal activity in 2024. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue agreed to buy rival Neiman Marcus in July, the same month Macy's scrapped talks with an investor group looking to buy the chain for nearly $7 billion.

    "title": "Prepare For Further Downside Volatility Before Fed's Rate Cut, And After",
    "text": "Onfokus/iStock via Getty Images The toughest week so far for the toughest month of the year By now, even a newcomer to stocks should be acquainted with how hard September is to navigate. No one can point to a specific reason why the Fall is so difficult; anyone who pays any attention to their portfolio will in time recognize it. Even investors who confine themselves to just scanning statements at the end of the month may catch on after a few years. September and early October are very difficult months to make any headway, let alone to hold on to all your hard-earned gains. It seems that this September is turning out to be the most difficult to master in a few years. Not only was this past week notable in being the worst week of 2024, for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, but It was the worst week for the Nasdaq since June of 2022 while the S&P confronted its worst week since March of 2023. Just this Friday alone, the Nasdaq dropped 2.5% with technology the weakest sector. If everyone knows that stocks sell-off this month, why hasn’t it been discounted away by now? Efficient market theory holds that because there is so much research, attention, and individuals risking their hard-earned dollars, all stocks are perfectly valued at all times, therefore trading, and investing in individual stocks are a waste of time. Better to just invest in an index, adding to it year over year, which is good advice for most people. If you are reading Seeking Alpha, you don’t ascribe to the “efficient market” theory. Exhibit “A” would be a seasonal pattern or any other pattern that a diligent observer should be able to identify. Rule number 1 of technical analysis patterns does exist. Rule number 2, patterns continue to propagate until they don’t. I know this sounds like something Yogi Berra would say, but that doesn’t mean it’s nonsense. Many “Yogi-isms” are often repeated not only because they sound funny, but also because they have inherent wisdom. In this case, assume that a pattern you’ve identified is still in force until the pattern is disrupted. Technical analysis must respect patterns since that is what is being identified in charts, a “double top,” or “head-and-shoulders” is a pattern that means something, you can’t read a chart without them. Now to the difficult question as to why the fall in the Fall still happens. It is especially difficult because we don’t understand why it happens so regularly. This year, it is easier to accept because we have had quite many months of nearly unending rally until recently. At some point, stock positions become “full,” meaning there aren’t enough new buyers to counter the sellers who might be selling for non-fundamental reasons. A strong non-fundamental reason is that summer vacation time is over, and senior money managers of hedge funds, pensions, and the like decide they want to “bank” their gains for the year. This could be especially true for the strong gains we’ve had this year. It could also mean someone is retiring and wants to sell equities and buy bonds for a steady income. We are experiencing a wave of boomers retiring. There are a myriad of reasons to sell even the best names. If there are no new countervailing buyers, stocks fall through for no particular reason other than stocks are fully valued. Some people might call that a “buyers strike,” which is further exacerbated by fear of a meltdown in the fall. So why does the pattern persist even when many, if not most market participants are free to take action like selling in August? Well, this year Fall came early on August 5th with a sharp sell-off, propelled by the question that is layered on top of the seasonal pattern - the “Growth Scare”. We’ll deal with the “Growth Scare” in more detail below. The pattern persists because sometimes it doesn’t happen, or the most drastic drops happen in early October, sometimes, as in this case, there is a really good reason for market participants to take profits. Finally, the Fed is going to cut rates, maybe it’s now cutting because it has to. For the past nearly 2 years, the promise of a Fed rate cut has been mooted again and again. Finally, now that it is clear that the rate raises, the sharpest rise in our generation has finally gained traction and has begun arresting demand, slowing price gains - commonly referred to as inflation. Disinflation does not mean lowering current prices, it only means that the rate of inflation is being arrested. Deflation and the fall of prices is something that we can wish for, but pray it doesn’t happen. Deflation on a wide scale means economic ruin is afoot. There is such a shortage of demand that current prices fall, a shortage of demand that is strong enough to retard prices is known as a depression. Massive layoffs happen because people are thrown out of work, and companies that rely on consumer demand go bankrupt. We don’t want that. Currently, the fall in demand is incremental and through the skill and tenacity of the Fed, demand has fallen only enough to defeat high inflation, moving back to the more temperate 2% level. We aren’t there yet, but inflation is moving in that direction. The long and variable lag of when higher rates bite is at an end, we all see that the higher rate regime is showing evidence of slowing; here are some of the recent economic data that has only recently surfaced. The “Growth Scare” is very real in that there is a possibility that the Fed has waited too long The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is under $70, lower oil has meant lower economic activity, both in logistics and consumer demand. Oil was supposed to hit $90 according to many earlier in the year. Even the peak in oil in late summer was not due to demand but geopolitical fears, and it was only just hitting the higher end of its established trading range. Some will say that there is ample supply and that is what is keeping down the price. I won’t argue, let’s just say that it is a data point that deserves mention. The 10-Y US Bond is at a 14 months low, here again, one can say that it's because the Fed is cutting rates, but we’ve known that for more than a year. It would make sense for the 2-Y to drop, but why is the 10-Y so low? It has been inverted for quite a long time, signaling recession. Now that the Fed is about to lower the fund rate, the 10-Y US bond has rapidly dropped lower. The Dollar Index ( DXY ) traded under 101 before closing at 101.15 on Friday, having touched 100.40 on August 27, a level not seen since the early Spring of 2022. The DXY has tagged the 100-handle for the past few weeks several times. A lower dollar can mean less economic growth, as investors are finding better places to put their money. It could also just be a function of lower interest rates. Again, this is a data point worthy of mention. A corollary data point is that Gold is breaking to new all-time highs nearly every other day. Again, it could be related to interest rates and the lower DXY. I believe they are all interacting with each other, overall Gold is gaining as an alternative to the dollar globally. Other more pertinent indicators of slowing growth are the monthly employment numbers this week, jobs came in at 141K to the 160K expected. More concerning is the prior month revised downward from 114 thousand to 89 thousand, with June also revised downward. Wednesday's JOLTS data showed July's job openings fell to the lowest level since January 2021. Thursday's ADP data showed the lowest monthly growth of private jobs, also since 2021. To be fair, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2% from 4.3%. Average hourly earnings risen 0.4%; up 3.8% year-on-year. Many of you have heard this dismal litany more than once. I am merely setting the table. Also, I for one, have heard these statistics as a stream of data, here altogether, it makes for a potent argument for the Growth Scare narrative. We had a very sharp preview of it on August 5th, this was related to the employment tally, but for July. This is a pattern as well, and one that I am winding up to soon. However, as is often the case with narratives, it is part of a two-sided debate, played out in the price of equities as is nearly always the case. If you can’t identify what the debate is about the correct price of stocks, you aren’t paying enough attention. The Debate is between dueling narratives; Growth Scare or Soft Landing Soft landing: Remember that tired term mentioned in the ad infinitum? You haven’t heard it all that much lately because the media has a new shiny object to get clicks. The whole point of raising rates was to slow demand, credit is the lifeblood of the economy, and when you pay more for it eventually, often too slowly, we see evidence of it finally working. All of this economic data is precisely what the Fed wanted to see to cut inflation down to size. Now that we see evidence of it, it is roiling the markets, my thesis is that this is a new paradigm for the stock market, and you’d better get used to it. We are entering into a market with a lack of visibility, rule number one of the stock market – it abhors a lack of clarity. It is unclear whether the current evidence of economic slowing is a prelude to recession, or whether the Fed has done a masterful job in slaying inflation. I believe Q3 is still projected to be above 2%, so no sign of recession friends. It could be both We could see a negative month in Q1 of 2025, and it may not even matter. Stock market participants look ahead, and the view a few months from now might be very sunny indeed. Why do I say that? Lower rates will lay the foundation for increased economic growth in 2025, and corporate profits for this quarter and Q4 of 2024 will likely still be positive. They could be very strong because productivity is back up 2.5% in the latest reading. Is it because companies are shedding the over-hiring post-pandemic, or because those recent hires are more productive due to experience? I think it is both of those things and better, faster-adapting information systems. I say it might be all 3, in case you haven’t heard, generative AI has finally automated software development. You still need developers that know how to code because the resulting code has to be as efficient as possible, and made to address user needs precisely. This means that true software engineers, especially those that know how to work with AI, will still find jobs. Less trained, lesser talented coders might not. I digress, we need to adapt as well to a new stock market, one that is more volatile, but that will offer stronger returns for stock pickers and traders. Investors can ignore the day-to-day volatility, just keep investing month by month and lower the cost basis of your favorite stocks. As for me, I am allocating a nice chunk of my investment dollars this month and the first two weeks of October. I have been holding off just for this occasion, and loyal readers should remember that I said that I was going to do this months ago. Let me now illustrate the pattern we’ve been experiencing so far. Here is the S&P 500 Index ETF ( SPY ) 3-month chart. TradingView As I said earlier, patterns repeat (until they don’t), so unless I see otherwise, I assume that after the rough week we had, we should see a recovery at least until Wednesday. Then see the rest of the drop the following week, or maybe it starts on Friday, or even Thursday this week. This week we have CPI on Wednesday and I expect it to be unremarkable, still edging down at a moderate pace. The stock market might rejoice at that and bid stocks higher on Thursday. The following week we have September 18, when the Fed, after a very, very long wind-up will cut the Fed Funds Rate (FFR). I think we will have trepidation Monday, and Tuesday, and then maybe disappointment when Powell cuts by only .25% or panic if Powell cuts by .50%. Either way, I expect the “Growth Scare” to be at its peak. Let me lay it out for you, if it's .25% then the “Recessionistas” (remember them?) will get on the megaphone to announce that Powell is once again too late. If Powell does cut by .50% (I am in the .25% camp) then those same Recessionistas will say “What does Powell see that we can’t yet see?” So either way, we drop. I will let you in on a secret, even if Powell cuts 100 BPs off of the FFR or even 125 BPs interest rates will still be restrictive. Even if it wasn’t, if we are truly headed for recession, which I don’t believe we are, then it will still take time for the cuts to filter through the economy and make a meaningful dent. Meanwhile, this kind of cutting would be fantastic for stocks, not right away, but with every additional cut, the market will get frothier. Let me vigorously argue against such a precipitous move by Powell. He doesn’t want a recession, but he certainly doesn’t want inflation to resurge either. Powell has said, more than once, that he would rather see a recession than inflation to reignite. My Thesis is Powell will cut .25%, but even if he cuts .50% the result will be the same, further downside movement, perhaps as much as 7% My Trades: I was hedged all week with Puts on the 3X Nasdaq-100 ETF ( TQQQ ), the 3X Chip ETF ( SOXL ), and the 3X S&P 500 ETF ( SPXL ). On Friday, I closed all my hedges, and actually got long with Calls on SOXL and Zscaler ( ZS ) I think tech stocks will find a lot of dip buyers this coming week, with chips and security stocks leading the way. I am still long the Silver ETF ( SLV ), I am also still long and underwater on SentinelOne ( S ), I am long Rocket Companies ( RKT ) Calls out to March of 2025. With mortgage rates continuing to come down, I think refinancing will be a thing in the coming months. Best of luck, everyone!

    "title": "Global Stocks Surge as China Announces Economic Stimulus Measures",
    "text": "LONDON/SINGAPORE, – Global stock markets hit record highs on Tuesday following China’s announcement of new stimulus measures aimed at supporting its slowing economy. The move boosted Asian and European stocks and triggered a rise in commodity prices. People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng revealed plans to lower borrowing costs, inject more funds into the economy, and ease household mortgage repayment burdens. The PBOC also plans to introduce structural monetary policy tools to stabilize capital markets for the first time. These measures sparked significant gains in Chinese stocks, with the blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite index both surging over 4%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also jumped 4.1%, reaching a four-month high. “The immediate reaction is certainly positive for markets because the measures have been more forceful than previous ones,” said Ecaterina Bigos, Chief Investment Officer for Asia (ex Japan) at AXA Investment Managers. “However, for a sustained impact, we need to see further support from fiscal policies as we approach the year-end.” Despite these gains, Chinese stocks have underperformed in Asia, with the CSI300 index down 2.3% this year, largely due to previous stimulus efforts failing to revitalize the market. In Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6%, led by gains in China-exposed mining and luxury stocks. Germany’s DAX also traded near record highs. Meanwhile, the MSCI World Index, which tracks global equities, gained 0.3%, reaching a record high. U.S. futures suggested a quiet opening on Wall Street, with modest gains expected. Commodity markets responded positively to the upbeat mood, with oil prices climbing over 2%. Copper prices surged to a 10-week high on expectations of increased demand from China. Iron ore futures on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange saw their largest intraday gain in over a year, while gold prices hit a record high of $2,639.95 amid rising tensions in the Middle East, fueling demand for safe-haven assets. Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept interest rates unchanged, maintaining a tight policy stance. This contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which began its easing cycle last week with a 50-basis-point rate cut. The Australian dollar rose 0.1% to $0.6846, briefly reaching its strongest level of the year. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen, touching a 20-day high. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled no rush to raise rates, emphasizing a cautious approach to monetary policy adjustments. U.S. markets remain divided on whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 50 or 25 basis points in November. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are pricing in 76 basis points of easing by year-end. Elias Haddad, Senior Markets Strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, warned that the market might be overestimating the Fed’s ability to continue easing. “It will likely take strong U.S. jobs data to prompt a reassessment of Fed rate expectations,” Haddad noted, with the next key data release, the non-farm payrolls report, due on October 4. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six major rivals, edged slightly lower to 100.86, close to a one-year low. The euro also rose 0.1% to $1.1123 after dropping on Monday amid weak eurozone business activity data, which heightened expectations for further rate cuts by the European Central Bank. This surge in global stock markets comes as policymakers around the world navigate economic uncertainties, with China’s aggressive stimulus plan providing a temporary boost to investor confidence.

    "title": "Here’s Michelle Obama’s Speech At The DNC In Full",
    "text": "Topline Former First Lady Michelle Obama criticized former President Donald Trump, suggesting he was campaigning for a “Black job,” and heaped on support for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, during her speech Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention. The former First Lady criticized former President Donald Trump, suggesting Trump was vying for a ... [+] “Black job.” Key Facts Obama, who followed a speech from First Gentleman Doug Emhoff, repeated a phrase used by Trump on his campaign trail while discussing immigration's impact on the American workforce: “Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’?” Obama also criticized Trump for his “limited, narrow view of the world,” adding Trump “did everything in his power to try to make people fear us.” She also honored her mother, Marian Robinson, who died in May, saying she was unsure whether she would be able to take the stage because “the last time I was here in the hometown was to memorialize my mother.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here . Here’s The Full Speech Hello, Chicago. Yeah. All right. Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it? You know, we’re feeling it here in this arena, but it’s spreading across this country we love. A familiar feeling that has been buried too deep for far too long. You know what I’m talking about. It’s the contagious power of hope. The anticipation, the energy, the exhilaration of once again being on the cusp of a brighter day. The chance to vanquish the demons of fear, division and hate that have consumed us and continue pursuing the unfinished promise of this great nation, the dream that our parents and grandparents fought and died and sacrificed for. America, hope is making a comeback. Yeah. But, to be honest, I am realizing that, until recently, I have mourned the dimming of that hope. And maybe you’ve experienced the same feelings, that deep pit in my stomach, a palpable sense of dread about the future. And for me, that mourning has also been mixed with my own personal grief. The last time I was here in my hometown was to memorialize my mother — the woman who showed me the meaning of hard work and humility and decency, the woman who set my moral compass high and showed me the power of my own voice. Folks, I still feel her loss so profoundly. I wasn’t even sure if I’d be steady enough to stand before you tonight, but my heart compelled me to be here because of the sense of duty that I feel to honor her memory. And to remind us all not to squander the sacrifices our elders made to give us a better future. You see, my mom, in her steady, quiet way, lived out that striving sense of hope every single day of her life. She believed that all children, all — all people have value. That anyone can succeed if given the opportunity. She and my father did not aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed. They understood that it wasn’t enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning. So, my mother volunteered at the local school. She — she always looked out for the other kids on the block. She was glad to do the thankless, unglamorous work that for generations has strengthened the fabric of this nation. The belief that if you do unto others, if you love thy neighbor, if you work and scrape and sacrifice, it will pay off. If not for you, then maybe for your children or your grandchildren. You see, those values have been passed on through family farms and factory towns, through tree-lined streets and crowded tenements, through prayer groups and National Guard units and social studies classrooms. Those were the values my mother poured into me until her very last breath. Kamala Harris and I built our lives on the same foundational values. Even though our mothers grew up an ocean apart, they shared the same belief in the promise of this country. That’s why her mother moved here from India at 19. It’s why she taught Kamala about justice, about the obligation to lift others up, about our responsibility to give more than we take. She’d often tell her daughter, “Don’t sit around and complain about things. Do something.” So, with that voice in her head, Kamala went out and she worked hard in school, graduating from an H.B.C.U., earning her law degree at a state school. And then she went on to work for the people, fighting to hold lawbreakers accountable, strengthening the rule of law, fighting to give folks better wages, cheaper prescription drugs, a good education, decent health care, child care, elder care. From a middle-class household, Kamala worked her way up to become vice president of the United States of America. My girl, Kamala Harris, is more than ready for this moment. She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency. And she is one of the most dignified. A tribute to her mother, to my mother and to your mother, too. The embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country. Her story is your story. It’s my story. It’s the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life. Look, Kamala knows, like we do, that regardless of where you come from, what you look like, who you love, how you worship, or what’s in your bank account, we all deserve the opportunity to build a decent life. All of our contributions deserve to be accepted and valued. Because no one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American. No one. Kamala has shown her allegiance to this nation. Not by spewing anger and bitterness, but by living a life of service, and always pushing the doors of opportunity open to others. She understands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business — if we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third or fourth chance. If things don’t go our way, we don’t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead. No. We don’t get to change the rules so we always win. If we see a mountain in front of us, we don’t expect there to be an escalator waiting to take us to the top. No. We put our heads down. We get to work. In America, we do something. And throughout her entire life, that’s what we have seen from Kamala Harris. The steel of her spine, the steadiness of her upbringing, the honesty of her example and yes, the joy of her laughter and her light. It couldn’t be more obvious. Of the two major candidates in this race, only Kamala Harris truly understands the unseen labor and unwavering commitment that has always made America great. Now, unfortunately, we know what comes next. We know folks are going to do everything they can to distort her truth. My husband and I sadly know a little something about this. For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black. I want to know — I want to know — who’s going to tell him, who’s going to tell him, that the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs? It’s his same old con. His same old con. Doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better. Look, because cutting our health care, taking away our freedom to control our bodies, the freedom to become a mother through I.V.F., like I did — those things are not going to improve the health outcomes of our wives, mothers and daughters. Shutting down the Department of Education, banning our books — none of that will prepare our kids for the future. Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love, look, that doesn’t make anybody’s life better. Instead, instead, it only makes us small. And let me tell you this: Going small is never the answer. Going small is the opposite of what we teach our kids. Going small is petty. It’s unhealthy. And quite frankly, it’s unpresidential. So, why would any of us accept this from anyone seeking our highest office. Why would we normalize that type of backward leadership? Doing so only demeans and cheapens our politics. It only serves to further discourage good, big-hearted people from wanting to get involved at all. America, our parents taught us better than that. And we deserve so much better than that. That’s why we must do everything in our power to elect two of those good, big-hearted people. There is no other choice than Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. No other choice. But as we embrace this renewed sense of hope, let us not forget the despair we have felt. Let us not forget what we are up against. Yes, Kamala and Tim are doing great now. We’re loving it. They are packing arenas across the country. Folks are energized. We are feeling good. But remember, there are still so many people who are desperate for a different outcome, who are ready to question and criticize every move Kamala makes, who are eager to spread those lies, who don’t want to vote for a woman, who will continue to prioritize building their wealth over ensuring that everyone has enough. So no matter how good we feel tonight, or tomorrow, or the next day, this is going to be an uphill battle. So folks, we cannot be our own worst enemies. No. See, because the minute something goes wrong, the minute a lie takes hold, folks, we cannot start wringing our hands. We cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right. And we cannot indulge our anxieties about whether this country will elect someone like Kamala, instead of doing everything we can to get someone like Kamala elected. Kamala and Tim, they have lived amazing lives. And I am confident that they will lead with compassion, inclusion and grace. But they are still only human. They are not perfect. And like all of us, they will make mistakes. But luckily, y’all, this is not just on them. This is up to us, all of us, to be the solution that we seek. It’s up to all of us to be the antidote to the darkness and division. Look, I don’t care how you identify politically, whether you are Democrat, Republican, independent or none of the above. This is our time to stand up for what we know in our hearts is right. To stand up not just for our basic freedoms, but for decency and humanity. For basic respect, dignity and empathy. For the values at the very foundation of this democracy. It’s up to us to remember what Kamala’s mother told her: Don’t just sit around and complain, do something. So if they lie about her, and they will, we’ve got to do something. If we see a bad poll, and we will, we’ve got to put down that phone, and do something. If we start feeling tired, if we start feeling that dread creeping back in, we’ve got to pick ourselves up, throw water on our face, and what? We only have two and a half months, y’all, to get this done. Only 11 weeks to make sure every single person we know is registered and has a voting plan. So we cannot afford for anyone, anyone, anyone in America to sit on their hands and wait to be called. Don’t complain if no one from the campaign has specifically reached out to you to ask you for your support. There is simply no time for that kind of foolishness. You know what you need to do. So consider this to be your official ask. Michelle Obama is asking you — no, I’m telling y’all — to do something. This election is going to be close. In some states, just a handful — listen to me — a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner. So we need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt. We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us. Our fate is in our hands. In 77 days, we have the power to turn our country away from the fear, division and smallness of the past. We have the power to marry our hope with our action. We have the power to pay forward the love, sweat and sacrifice of our mothers and fathers and all those who came before us. We did it before y’all, and we sure can do it again. Let us work like our lives depend on it, and let us keep moving our country forward and go higher, yes, always higher than we’ve ever gone before, as we elect the next president and vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Thank you all, God bless",

The Importance of Insider Transactions Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. Exploring the legal landscape, an \"insider\" is defined as any officer, director, or beneficial owner holding more than ten percent of a company's equity securities, as stipulated by Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This encompasses executives in the c-suite and major hedge funds. These insiders are required to report their transactions through a Form 4 filing, which must be submitted within two business days of the transaction. Highlighted by a company insider's new purchase, there's a positive anticipation for the stock to rise. But, insider sells may not necessarily indicate a bearish view and can be motivated by various factors. Unlocking the Meaning of Transaction Codes Examining transactions, investors often concentrate on those unfolding in the open market, meticulously detailed in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 denotes a purchase, while S signifies a sale. Transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option, and transaction code A denotes a grant, award, or other acquisition of securities from the company.

    "title": "Religious Freedom From Taxes? SCOTUS Will Hear Key Case in 2025",
    "text": "If you’re wondering what the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and religious liberty have to do with taxes, you’re probably not alone. These issues are converging in the news now that the U.S. Supreme Court (“SCOTUS”) just agreed to hear a religious tax exemption case. Essentially, the High Court will decide whether the Catholic Charities Bureau of the Diocese of Superior in Wisconsin and its affiliated organizations should be exempt from Wisconsin’s unemployment tax system. Unemployment taxes help fund u nemployment benefits , supporting those who lose their jobs. Catholic Charities has reportedly paid the tax since the 1970s.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. On its face, this case ( Catholic Charities Bureau v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission ) might sound like a less-than-tantalizing state-level labor tax dispute. However, many will be watching to see how the court’s eventual ruling might reshape the landscape of religious liberty and tax law across the United States. So, here’s what you need to know. Supreme court tax case The Catholic Charities Bureau is a social service organization affiliated with the Diocese of Superior in Wisconsin. Founded over 100 years ago, the Bureau operates various programs to assist the poor, older adults, and those with disabilities Catholic social teachings reportedly guide the organization But Catholic Charities says it serves people without regard to their religious beliefs In this case, the Bureau argues that it and four agencies under its control should be exempt from Wisconsin’s state unemployment tax because they operate \"primarily for religious purposes.” However, the Wisconsin Supreme Court looked at the nonprofit organizations involved ( not the church) and ruled the organization's activities aren't religious in nature. Thus, they denied the tax exemption. Writing for the majority, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley explained, “If we looked to the church's purpose in operating the organization only, then any religiously affiliated organization would always be exempt.\" In a release regarding the state’s ruling, attorney Eric Rassbach stated, “Penalizing Catholic Charities for serving Catholics and non-Catholics alike is ridiculous and wrong.” Rassbach is vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead attorney for the charities in the case. In its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , Catholic Charities contends that the Wisconsin Supreme Court's denial of the exemption violates First Amendment constitutional protection of religious freedom. SCOTUS has agreed to consider whether the obligation to pay the Wisconsin unemployment tax infringes upon protections for religious organizations in the U.S. Constitution. Unemployment tax The Federal Unemployment Tax Act ( FUTA) exempts churches and religious organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code from paying unemployment taxes that most employers pay, according to the IRS. Many states follow the federal example and exempt religious organizations from state unemployment taxes (SUTA). However, the exemption typically applies only to entities operated “primarily for religious purposes.” In Wisconsin , employers pay unemployment tax and contribute based on each employee's wages up to a taxable wage base of $14,000. Different rate schedules apply to small and large employers, and contributions finance the state's unemployment insurance program. The state argues that Catholic Charities and its affiliates are primarily non-religious because their activities are mainly secular. They serve people of all faiths and focus on social services rather than religious instruction or worship. The organization provides assistance based on humanitarian needs, not religious criteria, which the state sees as evidence of a fundamentally non-religious operational model. Also, employees of Catholic Charities reportedly don't have to be Catholic, and people receiving services from these organizations receive no religious training or orientation. The court also noted that the charity doesn’t proselytize or provide religious materials to its program participants. As a result, the court found that an \"objective examination\" of Catholic Charities' activities reveals them to be secular in nature.” In doing so, it emphasized that an organization's motivations and activities are each factors in determining whether it \"operated primarily for religious purposes\" under state law. Why this tax case matters This case is significant since it adds to the conservative Supreme Court's recent string of decisions expanding religious freedoms. For example, two years ago, in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District , the Court ruled in favor of a public high school football coach. The Court held that Kennedy’s right to pray on the field after games was protected under the First Amendment. Last year, the Court’s decision in Groff v. DeJoy , a case involving a USPS worker working on the Sabbath, enhanced safeguards for workers seeking religious accommodations. In 3 03 Creative v. Elenis , the court supported a web designer's refusal to create websites for same-sex weddings based on her religious beliefs. Additionally, a ruling in favor of Catholic Charities could potentially: Lead to a broader interpretation of religious exemptions in other areas of taxation Influence how states and the federal government approach the separation of church and state Impact funding and operations of religiously affiliated hospitals, universities, and other charitable organizations that serve the general public. On the Freedom From Religion Foundation website, FFRF Senior Counsel Sam Grover writes, “The special exemption that the Catholic Charities Bureau is seeking would naturally extend to countless other nonprofits. Thousands of nonreligious employees at hospitals, colleges, and other organizations could lose their unemployment coverage if the Supreme Court overturns [the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision].” FFRF is a nonprofit organization promoting constitutional principles of the separation of church and state. As the Court prepares to hear arguments, likely in the spring, many will ponder how this case and the conservative court majority will impact U.S. tax law. Buckle up.

    "title": "Honeywell: 3 Strengths And One Reason To Hold Back Your Excitement",
    "text": "JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Introduction It's been more than a year since I last covered multi-industry giant Honeywell International Inc. ( NASDAQ: HON ). In my May 2023 article , I provided an update on full-year 2022 and first-quarter 2023 results and examined the company's performance during the Great Recession, concluding that I would sleep very well with HON stock in the inevitable next recession - despite the company's cyclicality. At the same time, I concluded that Honeywell was not a compelling investment opportunity at the time, but I kept the stock on my \"recession watch list.\" Since then, Honeywell stock has been treading water, delivering a total return of only 4% compared to the S&P 500 Index ( SPY ), which gained over 30%. Considering that Honeywell also reported solid results for the remainder of 2023 and the first half of 2024 was also strong, it is reasonable to expect that the valuation of HON stock has improved. In this update, I would like to point out the three main reasons why I consider Honeywell stock to be a promising long-term investment and am increasingly considering adding it to my portfolio. However, as I will also explain, I still don't think HON stock is a good buy today, even though Honeywell is slowly but surely growing into its premium valuation. Reason 1: A Well-Aligned Portfolio, A Strong Backlog, And Significant Service Revenues Honeywell is broadly diversified across several industries, which I consider a key attribute of a solid long-term investment that I'd be comfortable holding through boom and bust cycles. The company is active in the development of aerospace, automation and security solutions, among many others. Honeywell generated about a third of its 2023 sales from services (Figure 1). The company can therefore be seen as being shielded to a considerable extent from short-term cost-cutting measures by its customers. Importantly, many of the company's products and services relate to mission-critical areas where savings are difficult or impossible to achieve. This is particularly true for the aviation industry. Figure 1: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): 2023 segment sales and percentage of service-related revenues (own work, based on data from company filings) Honeywell is well-positioned to benefit from several secular growth trends (aerospace, automation and energy transition in particular). In Q1 2024, the company has realigned its business segments to better reflect these key growth pillars and now reports in the following four segments: Aerospace Technologies (\"AT\") Industrial Automation (\"IA\") Building Automation (\"BA\") Energy and Sustainability Solutions (\"ESS\") Segment sales and their year-over-year development are shown in Figure 2. The most recent notable changes in the portfolio were the completion of the acquisition of the Global Access Solutions business (access control, electronic locks, mobile keys) from Carrier Global Corp. ( CARR ), which is now part of the BA segment, and the intention to acquire CAES Systems Holdings LLC from Advent International. CAES will be consolidated into the AT segment and is expected to significantly enhance Honeywell's position in radio frequency signal management, radar and sensor technologies such as those used on Lockheed's F-35, Boeing's EA-18 and Hughes/Raytheon's AMRAAM platforms. In the recently completed second quarter, sales in the AT segment grew organically by 16%, driven by the still strong post-pandemic recovery and overall solid demand for Honeywell's products (both commercial aviation and defense). IA recorded an organic sales decline of 8%, but order growth remained solid in the high single digits. BA and ESS also benefited from double-digit order growth, while sales lagged behind (+1% and +3%, respectively). Figure 2: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): First-half 2024 segment sales after business realignment and year-over-year change (own work, based on data from company filings) Taken together, it is therefore not surprising that Honeywell has a high order backlog, which amounted to $32 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year (blue bars in Figure 3). This represents almost 90% of Honeywell's net sales in 2023, almost twice as much as ten years ago (red line in Figure 3). Figure 3: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Period-end backlog and as a percentage of previous-year net sales (own work, based on data from company filings) Reason 2: Consistent Solid Returns On Invested Capital The acquisition of Carrier's access solutions business for almost $5 billion and the expected acquisition of CAES for around $1.9 billion show that Honeywell continues to focus on acquisitions to strengthen its portfolio and achieve good growth. Of course, the acquisition of large companies in particular does not go unnoticed, and a bargain - measured against the current growth prospects of the company to be acquired - is rarely made. Honeywell has quite a lot of goodwill on its balance sheet, which amounted to 30% of total assets at the end of the second quarter. If the company were to routinely overpay for acquisitions, its asset base would become increasingly bloated, worsening the relationship between earnings potential and assets. Therefore, I like to measure the quality of capital allocation using return on invested capital (\"ROIC\"), which relates net operating profit after tax to invested capital, including goodwill. Many websites publish ROIC excluding goodwill, but I think this is an overly optimistic approach that makes the asset base look too lean and ROIC therefore better than it is. This is of particular importance when analyzing serial acquirers. I also like to put the invested capital in relation to free cash flow (\"CROIC\") in order to gauge for a tendency for acquisitions that do not have a positive impact on free cash flow. Honeywell is a good example of a well-managed company that consistently delivers solid ROIC and CROIC (Figure 4). The difference is largely due to the fact that net operating profit after tax is calculated before interest, so the entire capital structure is taken into account. It can be debated whether the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\"CAPM\") is the correct way to determine a company's cost of equity and consequently, its weighted-average cost of capital, but I think it is fair to say that Honeywell is consistently able to generate reasonable returns in excess of its cost of capital. For the sake of completeness, Honeywell's WACC according to GuruFocus is currently 8.6%, which is based on a cost of equity of 9.6%, which in turn is based on a market premium of 6%. Figure 4: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Return and cash return on invested capital (own work, based on data from company filings) As an aside, I want to add that I always calculate free cash flow by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, treating stock-based compensation as a cash expense, and adjusting for working capital movements. In the specific case of Honeywell, and in addition to these adjustments, I have re-added a one-time cash outflow of $1.325 billion to the 2022 figure, which is related to the NARCO Trust and provides for the elimination of further funding obligations. Going forward, of course, it remains to be seen whether the company's recent acquisitions live up to expectations in terms of continued solid ROIC and CROIC, but I think it's reasonable to give Honeywell the benefit of the doubt - in part because of its solid margin expansion in recent years and management's continued positive guidance (Figure 5). Figure 5: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Historical gross-, adjusted operating-, and adjusted cash flow margin (own work, based on data from company filings) Reason 3: A Sound Balance Sheet – Look Beyond The Recent Debt Increase Finally, I think Honeywell deserves a lot of credit for maintaining a healthy balance sheet despite more or less regular - and partly debt-funded - takeovers and solid cash returns to shareholders. Of course, it is debatable whether the shares bought back when HON stock was more or less obviously overvalued represented a good return on capital. Over the last ten years, Honeywell has paid out nearly $23 billion in dividends and bought back $31 billion worth of stock, while maintaining a conservative level of leverage of around 1.5 times adjusted free cash flow (Figure 6). Figure 6: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Period-end backlog and as a percentage of previous-year net sales (own work, based on data from company filings) From around mid-2023, Honeywell's management has embarked on an acquisition spree, so to speak. I have already referred to the recently completed acquisition of Carrier's access solutions business for $5 billion and the expected acquisition of CAES for $1.9 billion. In addition, Honeywell acquired Compressor Controls Corp. (a turbomachinery services and controls business) for $673 million in 2023. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, Honeywell had $18.1 billion of net debt on its balance sheet. In addition, Honeywell recently announced that it intends to acquire the liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment business of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ( APD ) for approximately $1.8 billion. While I don't doubt that all of these acquisitions are a good fit for Honeywell, they could prove challenging in terms of integration. Management has demonstrated its ability in the past on several occasions, but integrating four companies valued at more than $9 billion - representing about 15% of Honeywell's total assets - definitely requires undivided attention and execution skill. The announcement of these acquisitions and the uncertainty surrounding them are probably one of the main reasons for the disappointing performance of HON stock since my last update. Management expects to generate free cash flow of around $5.7 billion this year, or around $5.5 billion if we consider stock-based compensation as a cash expense. Free cash flow will be sufficient to pay the estimated $2.9 billion in dividends for 2024 and $2.6 billion in expected share buybacks (HON will likely retire 2% of shares outstanding this year, see slide 4 of the Q2 2024 presentation ). Therefore, I expect the recently announced acquisitions to be fully financed by debt, which should bring net debt to around $22 billion by the end of the year, as shown in Figure 6 above (light blue). This sounds serious, of course, but should be seen in the context of Honeywell's strong earnings power and good cash flow conversion. I expect leverage to increase to four times expected 2024 adjusted free cash flow, which, I believe, is manageable for several reasons. Firstly, it should be borne in mind that measuring leverage based on free cash flow may give too conservative a picture, especially for a company that is currently investing heavily in growth. EBITDA is an alternative metric based on a more normalized view of capital expenditure (indirectly via depreciation and amortization). Rating agency Moody's, for example, expects Honeywell's leverage to be around 3.5x EBITDA once the recent acquisitions are completed. Secondly, I think it is important to point out that Honeywell is not currently expected to increase its debt beyond the amount it already has on its balance sheet. The pending acquisitions can easily be paid for with existing cash ($9.8 billion at the end of the second quarter), so the debt maturities reported at the end of the second quarter provide a reasonable starting point for further consideration. If we look at Honeywell's current outstanding debt (Figure 7), we see that the weighted-average interest rate must be around 3.5%, which translates to a comfortable interest coverage of 7 to 8 times pre-interest free cash flow, even excluding interest income from cash on hand. Honeywell's maturity profile appears to be skewed to the left, but note the x-axis scale in Figure 7 and the bucket size of three years. Since Honeywell generates at least $15 billion in free cash flow over a three-year period, or about $6 billion after dividends, the company could actually pay down its debt at maturity, assuming share buybacks are suspended. Figure 7: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Latest debt maturity profile and weighted-average interest rates (own work, based on data from company filings) I don't think Honeywell needs to deleverage in such a radical way, but I do think management will opt for a mix of share buybacks and debt reduction. As noted on slide 36 of the Investor Day 2023 presentation , the company plans to \" reduce [the] share count by a minimum [of] 1% annually via share repurchases .\" At today's HON share price, this would leave free cash flow of around $1.3 billion that could be used to reduce debt. Assuming that management is indeed not too aggressive with share buybacks, I think it is realistic that the leverage ratio will decline to three times adjusted free cash flow in roughly three years, barring, of course, a major recession. However, it should be noted that this does not include the cash flow from CAES and APD's LNG business and only a portion of the cash flow from Carrier's access solutions business. Based on management's recent remarks, I believe it is reasonable to expect all three divisions to generate annual free cash flow of around $270 million. The expected balance between share buybacks and debt reduction should also help Honeywell to maintain its good position with the rating agencies. For example, Moody's has rated Honeywell's long-term unsecured debt at A2, which is quite solid for an industrial company, and the rating outlook was upgraded to positive in September last year, largely due to strong free cash flow, which should \" allow the company to maintain debt-to-EBITDA in the mid- 2x range over that time [2024-2025].\" However, it should be added that at the time of the upgrade, the intention to acquire CAES (and APD's LNG business) was not yet known and Moody's noted in December 2023 that the acquisition of CAES was credit negative (but not enough to prompt a return to a stable rating outlook). All in all, Honeywell's solid balance sheet remains an important aspect in the company's favor, in my view. Granted, leverage is currently somewhat elevated, but remains manageable despite this significant acquisition, which again is a testament to the strength of Honeywell's (cash) earnings power. Valuation Update For Honeywell Stock We should keep in mind that the economy in the U.S. (and most of the rest of the world) is not exactly in great shape, but HON stock still trades at 20 times adjusted earnings, which equates to an expected annualized return of 7.4% by the end of 2026 (Figure 8). This takes into account a slight contraction in the valuation multiple to the long-term average of 18 times earnings. In my view, the market is appropriately valuing Honeywell's strong position in several growth areas and continued strong performance in aerospace, thanks to robust defense spending and a continued recovery in the commercial aviation industry. Figure 8: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): FAST Graphs chart, based on adjusted (operating) earnings per share (FAST Graphs) It could be argued that Honeywell deserves its current earnings multiple of 20 given its significantly improved profitability in recent years, but given the company's undeniable cyclicality, I don't think such an expectation is prudent. In my view, the market has already appropriately discounted Honeywell's improved profitability: After all, between the end of the Great Recession and through 2017, HON stock traded at a P/E ratio in the mid-teens. Other valuation metrics such as the price-to-sales ratio (P/S, based on expected 2024 sales) and metrics that take into account the entire capital structure (EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDA) suggest that the stock is fairly valued today (Figure 9), although it should be noted that all of these metrics saw significant expansion in recent years. Figure 9: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Current valuation compared with the historical average over ten years (own work, based on data from company filings) A starting dividend yield of just 2.2% is not exactly enticing either. Of course, Honeywell is a total return investment case, but the dividend yield still serves as a benchmark for valuation. As Figure 10 shows, HON's dividend yield is currently near the lower end of the trading range of the last ten years, suggesting a fair, if not somewhat high valuation. Figure 10: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Historical dividend yield (Seeking Alpha) Honeywell's management expects to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings (see slide 16, Q2 2024 earnings presentation), so longer-term increases are likely to be slightly higher than the most recent 5% hikes (Figure 11). However, even if we assume annual dividend increases of 7%, the yield on cost would only exceed the current yield on the 30-Year Treasury after 10 years. Figure 11: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Dividends paid per year and year-over-year growth (own work, based on data from company filings) And finally, although Honeywell shares have been treading water for several years now, they are no bargain from a discounted cash flow perspective either. If we assume a cost of equity of 8%, Honeywell would have to grow its free cash flow by 4% annually in perpetuity for the stock to be fairly valued today. This is certainly achievable long-term growth (Honeywell's free cash flow has grown by just over 5% over the past decade), but keep in mind that such models are strongly weighted towards cash flows far into the future. To give you an idea of the sensitivity of the model, Figure 12 shows several of cost of equity and growth-related scenarios. Figure 12: Honeywell International Inc. (HON): Discounted cash flow sensitivity analysis (own work, based on data from company filings) Conclusion: Playing The Waiting Game Honeywell shares have lagged the market significantly since my last article, although the company has continued to perform well, particularly against the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment. This is most evident in the current weakness of Honeywell's industrial automation division (weaker sales and margin compression due to pronounced operating leverage). However, order intake throughout the company remains solid, and the aerospace division in particular continues to surprise positively. Honeywell's backlog remains near the all-time high of $32 billion, which represents almost 90% of annual net sales. I remain confident that Honeywell is a solid long-term investment with a high-quality and well-diversified product and services portfolio that is well aligned with long-term growth trends such as business automation, energy transition and aerospace (commercial and defense-related). It is very encouraging that service sales now account for around a third of the company's total sales, which should dampen sales and earnings volatility in a recession and further strengthen customer loyalty. The company's profitability continues to improve and is already at a fairly solid level (gross margin in the 30% range, adjusted operating margin in the mid-20% range). Honeywell routinely generates solid returns above the cost of capital, both from an earnings and cash flow perspective. The recent acquisitions fit well into the portfolio, although one could argue that given Honeywell's level of diversification, it is becoming increasingly difficult to argue against a newly acquired company being at least a reasonably good fit. The related increase in leverage looks serious at first glance, but on closer inspection appears very manageable, and that's despite the fairly generous cash distributions to shareholders. In terms of valuation, I still don't consider HON stock a good buy, despite the significant underperformance since my last article. However, the stock is slowly but surely growing into its valuation, and the underlying performance remains solid, so I'm keeping it on my watch list. I could see myself opening a position if the dividend yield exceeds 2.5% (low $170s), which would equate to a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 and a free cash flow yield of almost 5%.

Dr. Kilcoyne joins us at a pivotal time for the Company, bringing extensive experience in drug development as we are progressing in our clinical programs. We expect to present Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025 for UCART22 in ALL and UCART20x22 for NHL\" said André Choulika, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. \"Additionally, we are excited to announce that research and development activities have started for three programs under our collaboration and research agreement with AstraZeneca: one allogeneic CAR T for hematological malignancies, one allogeneic CAR T for solid tumors, and one in vivo gene therapy for a genetic disorder. Cellectis is confident about the continued progress of its ongoing clinical trials in hematological malignancies and is excited about our strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, with whom we continue to advance our ambition in cell and gene therapy to bring potentially lifesaving therapies to patients with unmet medical needs.\" ________________________ 1 Cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets. Restricted cash was $5 million as of September 30, 2024. Fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets were $100 million as of September 30, 2024. Pipeline Highlights UCART Clinical Programs Cellectis continues to focus on the enrollment of patients in the BALLI-01 study, evaluating UCART22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We expect to present the Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025. Cellectis continues to focus on the enrollment of patients in the NATHALI-01 study, evaluating UCART20x22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We expect to present the Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025. The Company decided to focus its current development efforts on the BALLI-01 and NATHALI-01 studies and therefore to deprioritize the development of UCART123, currently evaluated in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Up to now, this study has provided important insights into the role of CD123-targeted allogeneic CAR-T therapy in relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia and the future development of our allogeneic CAR-T platform. MUC1 CAR T-cells for treating Triple-Negative Breast Cancer On September 3, 2024, Cellectis published a scientific article in Science Advances suggesting that TALEN®-edited MUC1 CAR T-cells could be a potential treatment option for advance-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with limited therapeutic options. In this article, Cellectis described its CAR T-cell engineering strategy using TALEN® and synthetic biology to multi-armor CAR T-cells with synergistic functionalities to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Partnerships Servier and Allogene – Allogeneic CAR-T Allogene's investigational oncology products utilize Cellectis technologies. Allogene announced that the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA3 trial was initiated in June 2024. This study is evaluating the use of cemacabtagene ansegedleucel (cema-cel) as part of the first line (1L) treatment regimen for patients with LBCL who are likely to relapse after standard 1L treatment. Allogene announced that ALPHA3 is the first pivotal trial to offer CAR T as part of 1L treatment consolidation. Allogene announced that enrollment is ongoing in the relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL cohort of the Phase 1 ALPHA2 trial of cema-cel, and that initial data readout from the CLL cohort is projected by early 2025. Allogene announced that a Phase 1 data update of the TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316 from approximately 20 patients with CD70 positive RCC is planned by YE 2024. In October 2024, Allogene announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-316 for the treatment of adult patients with CD70 positive advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). AstraZeneca – Joint Research and Collaboration Agreement Under the terms of the joint research and collaboration agreement entered into by Cellectis and AstraZeneca Ireland Limited (\"AstraZeneca\") on November 1, 2023 (the \"AZ JRCA\"), AstraZeneca is leveraging Cellectis' proprietary gene editing technologies and manufacturing capabilities to design novel cell and gene therapy candidate products. As part of the AZ JRCA, 25 genetic targets have been exclusively reserved for AstraZeneca, from which up to 10 candidate products could be explored for development. AstraZeneca has an option for a worldwide exclusive license on the candidate products, to be exercised before IND filing. Research and development activities under three cell and gene therapy programs have already started under the AZ JRCA: one allogeneic CAR T for hematological malignancies, one allogeneic CAR T for solid tumors, and one i n vivo gene therapy for a genetic disorder. Under the AZ JRCA, $47m have been triggered so far (of which $25m upfront and $22m reached development milestones for the three initial projects), in addition to reimbursement of research costs incurred under the AZ JRCA. Appointment On August 7, 2024, Cellectis announced the appointment of Adrian Kilcoyne, M.D., MPH, MBA as its Chief Medical Officer. Before joining Cellectis, Dr. Kilcoyne was Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research and Development at Celularity, advancing their oncology allogeneic CAR-T and NK Cell therapy programs. Prior to this, he was Chief Medical Officer at Humanigen. He has held numerous Oncology leadership roles across Research and Development, Medical Affairs, Commercial, Health Economic Outcome Research and Evidence Generation in both large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as AstraZeneca and Celgene. Dr. Kilcoyne graduated from Trinity College, Dublin Medical School. He initially trained in Gynecological Oncology at the Hammersmith Hospital in London and subsequently in Public Health Medicine at Oxford during which time he completed a Master's in Public Health. Dr. Kilcoyne then trained in pharmaceutical medicine and completed his MBA. Financial Results The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS\"). As from June 1, 2023, and the deconsolidation of Cibus, Inc. (formerly Calyxt, Inc.) (\"Cibus\") which corresponded to the Plants operating segment, we view our operations and manage our business in a single operating and reportable segment corresponding to the Therapeutics segment. For this reason, we are no longer presenting financial measures broken down between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants. In the appendices of this Q3 2024 financial results press release, Cibus' results are isolated under \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2023, and are no longer included for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to the deconsolidation. Cash: As of September 30, 2024, Cellectis had $264 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets. This compares to $156 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets as of December 31, 2023. This $108 million increase is mainly due to $140 million cash received from AstraZeneca as part of its equity investment in Cellectis, $16 million cash received from European Investment Bank (\"EIB\") pursuant to the disbursement of the €15 million Tranche B under the Finance Contract with EIB, $8 million of cash-in from our financial investments, $27 million of cash-in from our revenue, partially offset by cash payments from Cellectis to suppliers of $42 million, including $30 million to R&D suppliers and $12 million to SG&A suppliers, Cellectis' wages, bonuses and social expenses paid of $32 million, the payments of lease debts of $8 million and the repayment of the \"PGE\" loan of $4 million. With cash and cash equivalents of $159 million and $100 million term deposit classified as current financial assets as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents and deposits will be sufficient to fund its operations into 2027. Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $34.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This $26.8 million increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 was mainly attributable to (i) recognition of a $28.3 million revenue in 2024 based (a) on the progress of our performance obligation rendered under the three programs under the AZ JRCA and (b) the reaching of a development milestone under the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement dated March 6, 2019 between Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier (together \"Servier\") and Cellectis as amended (the \"Servier License Agreement\"), and (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in other income. R&D Expenses : Consolidated R&D expenses were $69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. R&D personnel expenses increased by $2.1 million from $25.7 million in 2023 to $27.8 million in 2024 mainly due to a reversal in September 2023 in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. R&D purchases, external expenses and other increased by $4.9 million (from $37.0 million in 2023 to $41.9 million in 2024) mainly related to increase in manufacturing activities to support our R&D pipeline. SG&A Expenses : Consolidated SG&A expenses were $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. SG&A personnel expenses increased by $0.5 million (from $5 million in 2023 to $5.6 million in 2024). SG&A purchases, external expenses and other increased by $1.5 million (from $7.1 million in 2023 to $8.6 million in 2024). Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income and expenses were a $0.9 million net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a $0.1 million net expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating income increased by $1 million primarily due to the recognition of revenues from American Depository Shares (\"ADS\") movements of $0.5 million and $0.3 million related to the subleased portion of our premises in New-York. Net financial gain (loss): We had a consolidated net financial gain of $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a $7 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This $12.6 million difference reflects mainly (i) a $14.3 million gain in change in fair value of SIA derivative instrument, (ii) a $5.6 million increase in gain from our financial investments, (iii) a $2.6 million gain in change in fair value of EIB Tranche A and Tranche B, (iv) the loss in fair value measurement on Cytovia convertible note recognized in the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 of $7.9 million, partially offset by (i) an increase of $1.8 million in interest expense on Tranche A and Tranche B of the EIB Finance Contractand (ii) a $5.3 million increase in foreign exchange loss, (iii) a decrease in net foreign exchange gain of $8.6 million and (iv) a $1.5 million increase of the loss in fair value of our investment in Cibus. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations : Net income from discontinued operations of $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 corresponded to Calyxt's results. Since Cibus has been deconsolidated since June 1, 2023, there is no longer any \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis : Consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $42.7 million (or a $0.49 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a $59.3 million loss (or a $1.09 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $75 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. The $24 million change in net loss was primarily driven by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $26.8 million, (ii) a $12.6 million change from a net financial loss of $7 million to a net financial gain of $5.7 million and (iii) a decrease in net other operating expense of $1 million, and (iv) a $8.4 million decrease in net income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, partially offset by (i) an increase of $6.4 million in purchases, external expenses and other, and a (ii) an increase of $0.8 million in wages and (iii) an increase of $1.7 million in non-cash stock based compensation expense. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis : Consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.4 million (or a $0.46 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million (or a $1.05 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Please see \"Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense, we believe that this financial measure, when considered together with our IFRS financial statements, can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis' financial performance. Moreover, our management views the Company's operations, and manages its business, based, in part, on this financial measure. In particular, we believe that the elimination of non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation, may address the impact of non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results, including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.

    "title": "These 4 groups of borrowers will qualify for Biden's next round of student loan forgiveness",
    "text": "The Biden administration is expected to move to forgive the student debt of tens of millions of borrowers as soon as October. These are the four groups who may benefit from partial or full debt relief, if the plan survives the next round of legal challenges. As Biden administration prepares to forgive the student debt of tens of millions of borrowers — a move experts say could happen as soon as October — it has issued new guidance on who will most likely be eligible for the relief. That's an important distinction from President Joe Biden 's first effort at sweeping student loan cancellation: With this attempt, the Education Department revised its forgiveness plan to be more targeted, with the hope that this aid package survives the inevitable next round of legal challenges . The Department is still working out the details of the plan, and will notify eligible borrowers soon. \"Once these rules are finalized, 30 million Americans will get to benefit and experience the life-changing impact of student debt cancellation,\" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. These are the four groups who stand to benefit from partial or full debt relief, if the plan survives the inevitable next round of lawsuits. Those who hold Direct or other Education Department-held loans and have a current balance greater than when they entered repayment may be able to get up to $20,000 forgiven, according to Department of Education guidance. The amount of relief they'll receive will depend, in part, on how much their balance has grown. More from Personal Finance: 'Underconsumption core' is in — and not a moment too soon, I say How to cut your wedding guest list: It's 'the No. 1 way to save,' expert says Kamala Harris' tax records reveal 'fairly basic' approach, experts say Experts say the Education Department will likely compare borrowers' present balance to the total principal and interest they owed when they began paying down their debt, whenever that was. Single individuals enrolled in income-driven repayment plans who earn under $120,000 could get the entire amount on their debt that has grown since they entered repayment, both principal and interest, erased. The income cap for married borrowers who file joint taxes is $240,000. The Education Department could also forgive the debt of the many borrowers who are eligible for relief but either haven't enrolled in the right program or applied for the aid yet. Many student loan borrowers aren't aware of the relief options available to them, such as income-driven repayment plans and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, consumer advocates say. If you have only undergraduate student loans and entered repayment on or before July 1, 2005, you will likely be eligible for the aid. For those with just graduate loans, or a mix of undergraduate and graduate debt, repayment must have begun on or before July 1, 2000, according to the Education Department guidance. Those who have consolidated their loans along the way shouldn't worry that their timeline reset. The Education Department says it will look into when those underlying loans initially entered repayment. In the fall, the Education Department will also likely try to cancel some or all of the debt of those borrowers who attended schools that lost their eligibility for federal funding, suddenly closed or provided \"low financial value,\" the agency said.",

    "title": "Supreme Court halts creditors meeting in Byju’s insolvency case",
    "text": "Mumbai: In the latest hurdle in the insolvency proceedings against Byju’s, the Supreme Court has directed the edtech firm’s resolution professional not to hold meetings of the company’s committee of creditors until the court passes its final judgement. This will delay the bankruptcy resolution proceedings as a meeting of Byju’s committee of creditors was scheduled for Thursday. “We reserve our judgement... and direct the resolution professional to not hold any CoC meetings until the final order is passed in the matter,” Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said on Thursday. A bench led by the Chief Justice and comprising Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Mishra was hearing an application filed by Glas Trust Inc. against Byju’s resolution professional, Pankaj Srivastava, for removing the US lender from the committee of creditors. Glas has also pleaded for removal of the insolvency expert. The top court asked the resolution or insolvency professional to maintain status quo in Byju’s bankcruptcy resolution. Also read | Why Byju’s creditors have dragged its insolvency professional to court Before Srivastava removed the US lender from for committee of creditors, Glas Trust held the lion’s share of the claims, representing roughly 99% of Byju’s total debt. Glas Trust has also opposed a settlement between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Byju’s, insisting that as a financial creditor to the edtech firm its dues should be settled first. On 23 September, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a decision declaring Byju’s to be in default on its $1.2 billion (about ₹ 11,000 crore) Term Loan B. Glas Trust represents a consortium of lenders that advanced the loan to Byju’s. Byju’s owes its financial and operational creditors dues amounting to more than ₹ 15,000 crore. The list of creditors includes BCCI, Surfer Technologies, Coegent E Services, Teleperformance Business Services, OPPO, McGraw Hill Education India, Incred Financial Services, ICICI Bank, and Aditya Birla Finance. ‘Gross misconduct’ Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Glas Trust, told the apex court that there had been ‘gross misconduct’ on the part of the resolution professional in removing the US creditor from the committee. The US lender informed the apex court that it had approached the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal on September 4 on the matter but did not get any relief since it was listed in the Supreme Court. Byju’s had entered into bankruptcy on 16 July when the NCLT admitted an insolvency petition by BCCI against Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd, the edtech firm’s parent company, for defaulting on dues worth ₹ 158 crore. “My (Glas Trust’s) claims worth ₹ 11,000 crores was verified and thereafter duly admitted by Srivastava,” Sibal said, adding that that the grounds for the US lender’s removal were that certain documents were not provided to the resolution professional. Tushar Mehta, solicitor general appearing for BCCI, opposed Glas Trust’s petition challenging Byju’s ₹ 158 crore settlement to the apex cricket board. Mehta said BCCI was “was not concerned about any adverse order in the current case” it was concerned about the “adverse consequences” the court’s order may have on the scope of settlements in insolvency matters.

    "title": "Get this into your head: we are now short of workers, not jobs",
    "text": "Last week, something strange happened without anyone noticing. We got the best monthly report on the jobs market we’ve ever had, and it was greeted with dismay. The message we’ve yet to get is that, when it comes to the need for jobs, our world has been turned on its head. Every month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics gives us the latest figures for what’s happening to employment and unemployment, based on a huge sample survey of Australia’s 10.5 million households. The figures we got last week, for September, showed that the number of Australians with jobs increased by more than 64,000 during the month, to 14.5 million. The number of people unemployed – wanting a job, but unable to find one – fell by 9000 to a bit under 620,000. Illustration: Simon Letch Credit: Why was this the best jobs report we’ve had? Because the proportion of the working-age population with a job reached an all-time high of 64.4 per cent. During September, the number of full-time jobs grew by 51,000, to reach 10 million for the first time. So, more than 80 per cent of the extra jobs were full-time. If the economy was booming, this strong growth in employment wouldn’t be so surprising. But the Reserve Bank has been applying the interest-rate brakes since May 2022, and the economy’s growth has been very weak for the past year or more. The only thing that’s been growing strongly is the population – which makes the limited worsening in unemployment all the more surprising. The new Minister for Employment, Murray Watt, boasted that more than a million extra jobs had been created since the Albanese government came to office in May 2022. “This is the most jobs ever created in a single parliamentary term by any Australian government,” he said immodestly. Loading So why was last week’s good news greeted with dismay? Because it was taken to mean the Reserve Bank will be in no hurry to start cutting interest rates. You know the media: always look on the dark side of life. Rates will come down in due course, of course. And with the jobs market holding up as well as it has, it gets ever harder to fear the economy will drop into recession. Silly people judge recession by whether the economy’s production of goods and services – gross domestic product – starts going backwards. But what makes recessions something to be feared is not what happens to production, but what happens to employers’ demand for workers. To the rate of unemployment, in other words. It’s when people can’t find work that they feel pain even greater than the pain people with big mortgages are feeling at present. When the pandemic lockdowns ended and people were finally able to get out and spend the money they’d earned, businesses started hiring more workers and unemployment fell sharply. By the end of 2022, the rate of unemployment got down to 3.5 per cent – the lowest it had been in about 50 years. But here’s the surprise: despite the big rise in interest rates designed to slow the economy and stop prices rising so fast – despite consumer spending becoming so weak – 28 months after the brakes were first applied the rate of unemployment has risen only to 4.1 per cent. That’s still much lower than we’ve seen during most of the past five decades. After the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s, unemployment got up to about 10 per cent. In the 2000s, we got used to a rate that started with a 5. Loading For about the first 30 years after World War II, our problem was finding enough workers to do all the work needing to be done. Since the mid-1970s, however, we’ve learnt to live with the opposite: not enough jobs for all the people – including married women – wanting to work. By now it’s become deeply ingrained in our thinking that there can never been enough jobs. Every politician and businessperson knows that, if you want to get your way, you promise to create more jobs. But here’s the surprising news: the unusually low rates of unemployment we’ve experienced this decade aren’t the temporary product of the ups and downs of the pandemic and its inflationary aftermath. They’re here to stay. That’s why the jobs figures are holding up so well. The half century in which jobs were always scarce has ended, and we’re back to the opposite problem: not enough workers to do all the work that needs doing. Loading Why? In five words: the ageing of the population. Because the proportion of people too old to work is growing, while families are having fewer children. Old people don’t stop consuming. They need more spending on services such as healthcare and aged care, which requires more workers. For years we’ve made up for our low fertility rate by allowing high rates of immigration. And we’ll keep seeking from abroad the many doctors and nurses and aged-care workers we need. Trouble is, all the rich countries have the same population-ageing problem we do. For different reasons, even China has a big ageing problem. So, the world competition for young skilled workers is likely to get a lot more intense. But isn’t that a problem off into the future sometime, like climate change? Don’t be so sure – like climate change. Loading With the high cost of home ownership and a shortage of rental housing, right now we ought to be building a lot more additional housing than we are. What’s the problem? A shortage of skilled workers, with many people who could be building homes off working on the state governments’ big infrastructure projects. And now that the Albanese government has approved the expansion of many coal mines, this will further reduce the number of skilled workers available to build homes. A shortage of jobs is no longer our problem. It’s a shortage of workers. Ross Gittins is the economics editor. Save Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later.

    "title": "Benzinga Founder Jason Raznick On Meme Stocks, Importance Of Diversification: 'Didn't Want To Lose A Generation Of Investors'",
    "text": "Loading... Loading... The rise of meme stocks in recent years has led to more investing education — and some investors realizing they need to diversify. What Happened: Benzinga founder and Chairman Jason Raznick shared his take on how meme stocks have changed the markets during an interview on the Schwab Networks' \"Market On Close\" Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic saw an influx of new retail traders get involved in the markets, which then shifted to the meme stock craze later, Raznick said. On Benzinga, content would often center on stocks like GameStop Corporation GME , he said, recalling that some readers would get mad when news like downgrades on the stock or caution around investing in meme stocks was shared. The caution around meme stocks came out of the history of dot-com stocks and investors getting wiped out, Raznick said . \"I didn't want to lose a generation of investors.\" Many companies that had IPOs during the dot-com period went bankrupt, the Benzinga founder said. Investors didn't leave the markets after meme stocks, which may have been due to education and diversification efforts, he said. More investors are looking at index funds and not just individual stocks on Benzinga, Raznick said. \"If this is your life savings, [it] doesn't make sense to be all in one stock.\" The Benzinga founder said it's the story that often drives meme stocks like GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC and Chewy Inc CHWY . \"There's no technicals to help explain these things,” Raznick said, adding that with some meme stocks, \"the story sounds so good.” Read Also: Innovation, Risk And Growth: Lessons In Entrepreneurship From Benzinga’s Co-Founder Jason Raznick What's Next: Schwab Network host Oliver Renick asked if the meme stock craze was a net positive: lots of people made money, but investors also lost money. \"I think it's a net positive, but close to being a net negative,\" Raznick said. One positive that came out of meme stocks was retail traders learning from social media and other investors to not put all their eggs in one basket, and to diversify. Raznick spoke of caution and diversification when it comes to the S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY . The Magnificent Seven stocks make up a large portion of the index and tracking ETFs, and Raznick said that if those stocks fall, \"the index gets killed.\" Raznick said he has been diversifying by buying equal-weighted S&P 500 ETFs. Schwab’s Renick named the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP as one option available for investors.

    "title": "Cansortium Inc. Completes New Senior Secured Credit Agreement Ahead of Planned Business Combination Closing with RIV Capital",
    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cansortium Inc. (CSE: TIUM.U) (OTCQB: CNTMF) (“Cansortium” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis company operating under the FLUENTTM brand, announced today that it has closed on a new senior secured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) of up to $96,500,000 with Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC (“Chicago Atlantic”), as administrative agent for certain lenders. The Credit Agreement bears a cash interest rate of 12.00% per annum and paid-in-kind (PIK) interest of 1.00% per annum, and is due to mature on November 26, 2028. The Credit Agreement refinances the existing $71,000,000 senior secured term loan that was set to mature May 29, 2025, thereby eliminating the previously disclosed requirement that the Company prepay $10,000,000 upon the consummation of the business combination with RIV Capital Inc. (CSE: RIV) (OTC: CNPOF) (“RIV Capital”), a vertically integrated cannabis company operating the Etain brand in New York. All required regulatory approvals needed for the business combination with RIV Capital Inc. have been obtained and the Company expects the closing with RIV Capital to occur in early December 2024. “We are excited to announce the successful completion of our senior secured refinancing. The loan’s favorable interest rate and single financial covenant underscore our strong financial standing, while its non-dilutive structure - free of equity or warrants – preserves shareholder value. As a result of this transaction, we have no material debt maturities until late 2028,” said Robert Beasley, CEO of Cansortium. “The refinancing includes access to two additional credit lines totaling $25 million, which, combined with the cash balance inflow from the RIV business combination, positions us to enter 2025 with a robust war chest. These resources will allow us to pursue strategic acquisitions and growth initiatives in key markets like Pennsylvania and New York, while also targeting new opportunities in emerging high-growth states. With our solid foundation and this enhanced financial flexibility, we are poised to capitalize on exciting industry developments at the state and federal levels. The future for our company – and our shareholders – has never been brighter.” The Credit Agreement provides for an initial loan of $71,500,000 and access to two additional credit lines of $10,000,000 for future real estate acquisitions and construction projects, and $15,000,000 in the event that the Company were to acquire RIV Capital’s Buffalo cultivation and processing facility following the completion of the business combination. “Cansortium has executed with prudence and foresight in its core states of Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas, and we have every confidence in their strategic approach to meet demands in additional markets,” said Peter Sack, Managing Parter of Chicago Atlantic. “They are innately focused on customer experience, fiscal responsibility, and operational excellence, and Chicago Atlantic is thrilled to support their next phase of growth.” The Credit Agreement includes a single financial covenant requiring Cansortium to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $4,500,000, tested at the end of each fiscal quarter, and includes customary terms and conditions for a financing of this type, including repayment obligations upon the occurrence of certain events of default thereunder. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed on the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca . Chicago Atlantic Credit Advisers, LLC served as lead arranger for the Credit Agreement and Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC serves as Administrative Agent for the Credit Agreement. Smith Transaction Cansortium and certain of its affiliates and William Smith, a director and the Executive Chair of Cansortium, and certain companies controlled by Mr. Smith (together with Mr. Smith, collectively, the “Smith Group”), have entered into an amended and restated termination agreement (the “Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement”) to replace in its entirety the existing termination agreement dated May 30, 2024 (the “Smith Transaction Termination Agreement”), which provided for, among other things, the termination of that certain agreement among Cansortium, certain of its affiliates and the Smith Group (the “Initial Smith Transaction Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement, Cansortium paid to the Smith Group a $500,000 cash fee and issued to the Smith Group a 15% secured subordinated convertible note in an initial aggregate principal amount of $6,500,000 due May 26, 2029 (the “Smith Convertible Note”). The Smith Convertible Note is subordinated in right of payment to prior payment in full of the Credit Agreement and the principal and accrued interest thereunder is convertible, at the discretion of the Smith Group, into Cansortium Shares at a price of $0.21 per Cansortium Share. For more information on the Smith Transaction Termination Agreement and the Initial Smith Transaction Agreement, see Cansortium’s news release dated May 30, 2024 filed under Cansortium’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca . The transactions contemplated by the Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement (the “Smith Transaction”) constitutes a “related party transaction” as such term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Securityholders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). Cansortium has relied on the exemptions from obtaining a formal valuation and minority shareholder approval of the Cansortium Shareholders with respect to the Smith Transaction in accordance with sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the aggregate fair market value of the cash consideration and the Smith Convertible Note issuable in connection with the Smith Transaction does not exceed 25% of Cansortium’s market capitalization as determined in accordance with the provisions of MI 61-101. In addition, the Smith Transaction was approved by the Cansortium Board, with Mr. Smith having disclosed his interest in the Smith Transaction and abstaining from voting thereon. Cansortium did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the Smith Transaction as the details of the Smith Transaction had not been finalized at that time.

    "text": "The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. ( NASDAQ: CHEF ) Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2024 8:30 AM ET Company Participants Alex Aldous - General Counsel, Corporate Secretary & Chief Government Relations Officer Chris Pappas - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Jim Leddy - Chief Financial Officer Conference Call Participants Alex Slagle - Jefferies Mark Carden - UBS Todd Brooks - The Benchmark Company Peter Saleh - BTIG Ben Wood - BMO Capital Markets Andrew Wolf - C.L. King Ben Klieve - Lake Street Capital Markets Operator Greetings, and welcome to the Chefs' Warehouse Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Alex Aldous, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Government Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Alex Aldous Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. With me on today's call are Chris Pappas, Founder, Chairman and CEO and Jim Leddy, our CFO. By now, you should have access to our second quarter 2024 earnings press release. It can also be found at www.chefswarehouse.com under the Investor Relations section. Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial measures, including, among others, historical and estimated EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as well as both historical and estimated adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. These measurements are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently in similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Quantitative reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures appear in today's press release. Before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our estimated financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of these risks are mentioned in today's release. Others are discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are available on the SEC website. Today, we are going to provide a business update and go over our second quarter results in detail. Then we will open up the call for questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Pappas. Chris? Chris Pappas Thank you, Alex, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Second quarter customer demand and pricing displayed typical seasonality as revenue and profitability continued to build as expected, moving from a solid first quarter into seasonally stronger second quarter months. Our operating divisions across domestic and international markets delivered strong unique customer and item placement growth and manage pricing effectively, while providing our customers with high-quality product and high-value service. We are extremely proud of all our teams from sales, sourcing, pricing, operations and support functions coming together to deliver value to our customers, leveraging our diverse and broad supply chain, value-add processing and culinary expertise to assist our customers with managing menu development as well as product and labor-related costs. A few highlights from the second quarter include, 7.2% organic growth in net sales. Specialty sales were up 7.5% organically over the prior year, which was driven by unique customer growth of approximately 8.2%, placement growth of 11.3%, and specialty case growth of 4.7%. Excluding prior year low-margin customer attrition in Hardies total specialty cases grew approximately 5.5% year-over-year in the second quarter. Organic pounds in center-of-the-plate were approximately 2.9% higher than the prior year second quarter. Gross profit margins increased approximately 35 basis points. Gross margin in the specialty category increased approximately 50 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2023, while gross margin in the center-of-the-plate category were essentially flat year-over-year. Jim will provide more detail on gross profit and margins in a few moments. We remain focused on making progress towards our five-year goals, which include 2028 revenue of approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $300 million to $350 million. It is important to highlight the key investments we have put in place to provide our teams with the market footprint, product categories, infrastructure and investment and sales force necessary to grow towards achieving these targets. Regarding infrastructure, since 2019, we have added approximately 1 million square feet of distribution capacity, excluding acquisitions or approximately a 60% increase to the 2019 baseline. These include investments in future growth in high-value markets such as the expansion of our distribution centers in Dubai, Seattle, Southern California and Florida. This also includes facility expansion to create future operating synergies, such as our recently completed protein processing facility in Northern California. During the second quarter we initiated processing operations and completed the first phase of a multiple facility consolidation with the move of our Brisbane processing and distribution operation. We expect to complete the next move during the third quarter with a focus on completing the full consolidation during the first quarter of 2025. We expect to provide route, labor and technology-driven efficiencies with room for future growth in the region. Regarding our investments in sales and our unique go-to-market strategy since year-end 2021, we have increased our sales force excluding acquisitions by approximately 10% per year. Over the same timeframe and certain of our high-growth investment markets such as Florida the Middle East and California, we have grown our sales force by approximately 20% to 25% per year on average. In addition, we continue to invest in category expertise and digital and pricing tools across our markets to support our sales and operating teams' execution, and growing market share via unique item penetration new customer acquisition and improved gross profit dollars per delivery. Our investments in acquisitions categories infrastructure and sales teams, have given us the marketing and distribution footprint required for growth towards our 2028 goals. We feel we have a balanced portfolio of high-growth markets supported by ample capacity, maturing sales teams with our unique go-to-market strategy complemented by more mature markets focused on category expansion and continued above-average industry growth. For the past 40 years, we have developed a moat in our niche of the food service industry by investing in and developing the talent and expertise to sell the world's finest chefs, to be logistically nimble and best-in-class to manage just-in-time service and to manage price and margins in a volatile world. We have built a culture and strategy, designed to be the unique Foodservice Solution Company, focused on serving quality culinary-driven operators. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim, to discuss more detailed financial information for the quarter and an update on our liquidity. Jim Leddy Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I'll now provide a comparison of our current quarter operating results versus the prior year quarter and provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity. Our net sales for the quarter ended June 28 2024, increased approximately 8.3% to $954.7 million from $881.8 million in the second quarter of 2023. The growth in net sales was a result of an increase in organic sales of approximately 7.2% as well as the contribution of sales from acquisitions, which added approximately 1.1% to sales growth for the quarter. Net inflation was 3.3% in the second quarter, consisting of 2.7% inflation in our specialty category and inflation of 4.3% in our center-of-the-plate category versus the prior year quarter. Gross profit increased 9.9% to $229 million, for the second quarter of 2024 versus $208.4 million for the second quarter of 2023. Gross profit margins increased approximately 35 basis points to 24%, and our procurement sales pricing and operating teams delivered strong gross profit dollar growth across categories during the quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 8.8% to $194.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, from $179 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization, driven by acquisitions and facility investments and costs associated with compensation, facility costs and distribution costs to support sales growth in the current quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9.8% versus the prior year's second quarter. And as a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating expenses were 18.1% for the second quarter of 2024. Operating income for the second quarter of 2024 was $33.9 million, compared to $25.3 million for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses versus the prior year quarter. Income tax expense was $6.7 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $3.5 million expense for the second quarter of 2023. Our GAAP net income was $15.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $9.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, we had adjusted EBITDA of $56.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $51.1 million for the prior year second quarter. Adjusted net income was $17 million, or $0.40 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $14.4 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the prior year second quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity. At the end of the second quarter, we had total liquidity of $208.3 million comprised of $38.3 million in cash and $170 million of availability under our ABL facility. During the second quarter, we continued to make progress towards achieving our year-end 2025 capital allocation goals of 2.5 times to 3 times net debt leverage and repurchasing $25 million to $100 million of equivalent outstanding shares. As of June 28, 2024 year-to-date, we have repurchased $10 million of our outstanding common shares resulting in a reduction of approximately 264,000 shares outstanding and repaid $14.5 million of outstanding debt. June 28, 2024, total net debt was approximately $661 million inclusive of all cash and cash equivalents and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.2 times as compared to approximately 3.3 times as of the first quarter of 2024. Turning to our full year guidance for 2024. Based on the current trends in the business, we are providing our full year financial guidance as follows; we estimate that net sales for the full year of 2024 will be in the range of $3.665 billion to $3.785 billion gross profit to be between $874 million and $902 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $208 million and $219 million. Please note for the third quarter of 2024, we expect both convertible notes maturing in December of this year and those maturing in 2028 to be dilutive for reporting purposes, and therefore, we expect the fully diluted share count to be approximately 45.9 million shares. For the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2024, we expect the remaining convertible notes maturing in 2028 to be dilutive, and therefore we expect the fully diluted share count to be approximately 45 million shares for the fourth quarter and full year reporting periods. Thank you. And at this point we'll open it up to questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Alex Slagle Good morning. Hi, guys. I wanted to ask on the case growth opportunity for the back half and maybe if you could just talk to some of the drivers and pipeline visibility you have that give you confidence being able to continue driving the organic case growth like you have recently. I know consumer demand in the restaurant industry more broadly seems to have gotten a bit choppier. So I just wanted to get your thoughts and things that give you confidence into the back half. Chris Pappas Sure. Yeah. So Andy [ph], I mean again I think that our clientele had a pretty strong second quarter. And I think when you look at last year, as well as you came into the summertime, it was a little choppy last year. I think what we're -- it's too early to see but I think it's kind of becoming more of a typical summer where a lot of people from the US travel. And last year we saw it like come roaring back again in September. So forecasting -- we're looking at bookings, we're looking at hotel bookings, we're looking at conferences, we're looking at corporate events, we're looking at -- talking to our customers. We see a pretty normal type of third fourth quarter as last year -- hopefully coming together. And we've invested so much in what we call the hybrid sale. We put lots of teams out there. We're cross-selling. We're putting more and more trained salespeople out in the street. We've added the capacity in the warehouses. So I think it's what we're expecting. We've invested in it. And obviously it could be up or down a little bit, but we feel pretty good about where we've invested and boots on the ground and our product mix which I think is the most unique in the industry. And we continue to see new openings and I think that's where we're winning a lot. I always say restauranteurs open restaurants. People that are in the hotel business want to build hotels. And I think what you're seeing more and more is -- I'm reading some of the reports where headcounts are down in restaurants 2%, 3% depending on your sector but we also have so many openings. So I think where Chef is winning is we're winning in the openings and that could be making up for any, sort of, headwinds in customer counts. Jim Leddy Yes, Alex, I'll just add that we're reporting first half of the year. New customer acquisition close to 10% just under 10%. Item placement growth double digits 11% to 12% and that's been making up for a little bit of the moderation that Chris mentioned that you're seeing in terms of demand or volume especially during the summer. And so some of the investments that we've made in those areas and category growth in sales force and some of the tools we're giving them are paying off. Alex Slagle Got it. And Jim a follow-up if you could provide any color around potential cadence of the margin leverage we have in the back half. I know the 3Q lapse there were some unique headwinds and some timing dynamics at play as you roll off like the increase from some of the new facilities now. Jim Leddy Yes. The guidance implies obviously in the first half of the year our organic growth was closer to 8%, but the full year guidance implies kind of 6% to 7% organic revenue growth. So we had already built in a deceleration a moderate deceleration in the back half of the year in terms of organic revenue growth. But that's really driven by the comparisons because if you remember last summer we really had a margin issue driven by the protein markets. It wasn't a volume issue. We had really good year-over-year volume and revenue growth. And so we're comping to a little bit of a tougher comp in the back half of the year. But that's really just driven by last year's cadence versus this year. Alex Slagle Okay. Thanks for the help. Operator The next question we have is from Mark Carden of UBS. Please go ahead. Mark Carden Good morning. Thanks so much taking my questions. So I want to dig in a bit more on sales your customers are holding up pretty well overall. I know last quarter you talked about some pressure at some of your casual customers. Does it remain pretty constrained to this customer segment? Or are you seeing it creep into a broader swath of your customers' restaurants? Chris Pappas Yes. I'm trying to recall really what you're referencing to. But again our customer base is extremely diverse. We purposely hire trained large teams to go after different types of business caterers, upscale fast casual, hotels, cruise ships all the way up to what I call super fine dining. So we purposely have the diverse clientele to kind of balance out anything that -- any headwinds in certain sectors. And as you can see the second quarter was pretty good. We felt our customer base did pretty well in an environment that we see a lot of the numbers coming out of QSR and some of the lower-priced restaurant groups. So we think our customers are pretty -- they're savvy. They understand how to -- where they have to promote, give a little bit more value. And on the higher end, I think that it is -- it's -- I think it's bifurcated. You have certain sectors that have slowed down a little bit. You see a lot of the reports coming out of other distributors and the restaurant reports and other parts of our clientele have accelerated. So I think that balanced attack is helping us put up pretty good numbers. Mark Carden Great. And then inflation appears to be pretty healthy. Any unusual dynamics to call out on that front? And just how are you thinking about it now for the balance of the year? Chris Pappas Not really anything to call out. I mean if you look at the first quarter and second quarter together, roughly 3% type of average inflation. I would say, there's a couple of categories on the specialty side that are driving probably the difference between kind of 2% and 3%. I mean, I think everybody is aware of what's happened with olive oil and some categories like chocolate driven by weather in different parts of the world. So excluding those, you're kind of in that normal kind of 2% to 3% range. And we don't really expect anything materially different at this point going forward. Mark Carden Great. Thanks so much and good luck, guys. Chris Pappas Thanks. Operator The next question we have is from Todd Brooks of The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Chris Pappas Hey, Todd. Todd Brooks Hey, guys. Congrats on the results in the quarter. A couple of quick questions for you. If you look across your customer base, just wondering what you're seeing as far as geographic disparities and performance. If you look at the California market, I don't know if some of that angst that we're hearing about broadly in the category has crept into the fine dining end of the sector there. And then we also hear that Florida remains a challenged market. So just wondering, if you look across the base, maybe strong versus weaker markets, and thoughts on that. Chris Pappas We haven't really seen a huge disparity across regions. I think we've mentioned -- I think we mentioned on our first quarter call that, we saw some of the higher-end steakhouses are down year-over-year from a traffic perspective where there's a bit of a trade down, where we're selling more high-end burgers versus the maybe the prime steaks, but we're still making good margin on those. So we see different dynamics across our regions. Our international markets are doing really well. And there's a number of domestic markets that are showing strength. Some are showing a little bit more moderation. I don't think there's any specific markets that we would call out as being significantly different. So I would just say that there's pockets of moderation across regions. Jim Leddy Yeah. I mean I'll add a little more color to that. I think that where there is a little bit of softness, I think in everybody reporting in the same-store sales. I think we're seeing the same thing and we're adding so many customers in Southern California where we've added a state-of-the-art facility and more boots on the ground. And I think it's the same in Florida. Florida had great numbers for us. They continue to grow. We started up pretty small. We just opened up our new facility. And I think any sort of softness in same-store sales, we're optimistic that we're making it up because we are winning, and we're adding -- continuing to add customers daily. And I think it's because of our size, too, we're relatively small, I think, to the major players that we're in Florida. And I think that the Chef go-to-market strategy, who we are, what we're selling is making up for any of that softness. And I think we've seen this in our past so many years in business, it's really a pattern that we've done pretty well even when there's some headwinds and some softness in the consumer. Todd Brooks That's great. And my second question and Jim, you pointed to the international markets doing very well. Can you just remind us on the distribution facility expansion timing for CME? And maybe a sense of what the old facility could handle capacity wise? And what it should be able to handle post the expansion being done? Thanks. Chris Pappas Yeah. Thanks for the question, Todd. Yeah. We're doubling the size of the facility. They were actually using a lot of kind of off-campus storage and freezer space which is fairly expensive. And so we'll be -- we'll finish that project probably at the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter and then do a kind of a phased move through the fourth quarter. So we'll see most of the growth in benefits really coming into 2025 and into 2026. But yeah, we're going from about 100,000 square feet to 200,000 square feet with a lot of room for growth and that market is growing. It's very dynamic. So we're pretty excited about it. And even in their current space, they've been doing really well as they continue to grow in that market. Todd Brooks Okay, great. Thanks guys. Chris Pappas Thanks. Operator The next question we have is from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh Great. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I did want to ask, it sounds like you guys are continuing to win with new restaurant openings and new restaurant formation. I think you mentioned new customer acquisitions up about 10%. Is there any reason to believe that new restaurant formation will slow or that this trend will slow at all over the coming years? Is there anything that leads you to believe that this trend won't continue? Chris Pappas Yeah. Great question. If I had the crystal ball, I feel a little bit better. But again, I could just go by our history and the world's changed since COVID. I think I remember even coming out of COVID, I said there's going to be an acceleration of openings because they were delayed, right, during COVID. And you see a lot of change in cities. You see the real estate dynamics of trying to reinvent buildings that were offices and trying to change those neighborhoods into more where they can add housing. We see a change in the suburbs where people are working more from home a few days a week. So I think restauranteurs continue to follow the money, and they continue to open restaurants where the traffic patterns seem to be especially with real estate developers a lot of them building restaurants to attract people to those areas, Peter. So I don't think I'm going to see much of a slowdown. I think a lot of the restaurant world is trying to reinvent itself to in a change. There's more takeout. There's more -- what we have seen as a proliferation of different types of restaurants and different types of food away from home. I mean, I continue to believe that people really are too busy to want to cook. Even when they go into the markets, they're buying a lot of prepared foods. And I think more and more of our great chefs, restauranteurs are getting more and more into that business. And I think that's making up for maybe where there is softness in the typical sit-down restaurants that people are used to. The other side of that business has accelerated and it's better food that you could take out or get delivered, or it's food that you could sit down and eat or you could take it home. So we're seeing a tremendous proliferation of new types of outlets for us to sell. Peter Saleh Great. And then just on the investment in the sales team, 10% annual sales growth or sales team growth over the past several years. Given your targets into 2028, are you anticipating to accelerate that or keep that kind of pace of investment in the sales team the same? Chris Pappas Yeah. I mean, I think the pace is what we budgeted and forecasted to spend. We're looking at the dynamics of our business. There's been so much talk about online will replace salespeople, which we think online is making salespeople more efficient and giving them more time to do what we really want them to do is be consultants. And I think I've been beating that drum for the last four or five years that the crystal ball says that online is going to get better and better. Younger people as they come into the industry are going to use a lot of those tools because they're so used to it being on an app and researching. So we are investing in better information, more information, online being a partner to our customer, assisting them in menu development, assisting them and chefs are curious, they're constantly wanting to learn and constantly wanting to invent. So we're trying to be that partner, that's supplying that information. And again, we continue to add people because we see that for what we do, and it might not work for everybody's business, they want to see somebody who is talking to them and we have a tremendous amount of talent that mans the phone still. And obviously, we could chat, if you want to be just online. So we like to give our customers choices and we think that we found a winning balance for now it can always change that really works for our customers and it's driving more volume to all our Chef customers, all our chef OpCos. Peter Saleh Thank you very much. Operator The next question we have is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Wood Hi. Good morning. This is Ben Wood on for Kelly. Thank you for taking our questions. So first we just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the unique customer growth and the placement growth and are there specific regions or markets that are driving that? Or is that fairly consistent throughout your markets? Just hoping you can help us frame how maybe high growth markets are comparing to your mature markets and if those high-growth areas you're investing in how they are tracking against your expectations? Jim Leddy Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. Yes we always have – like Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, we always have in our portfolio a mix of more mature markets like the Northeast and other areas that we've been operating for 40 years. And then our newer higher growth investment markets that we've talked about, as we're coming out of our heavy investment cycle like Florida and Southern California, Dubai, Seattle some of our smaller markets like Nashville and Michigan and that are – we're making investments in and we have higher growth. So yes, I mean it's like any portfolio of businesses, where your high-growth markets are going to contribute more to unique customer acquisition, your mature markets, you're growing more through category expansion and growing more relevance with your customers through item penetration, selling more items, as well as growing in the outlying markets call it the higher income suburbs around the major cities and that's how you grow in your mature markets. So we have 54 locations in 32 or 33 operating markets now. So there's always a good balance between your more mature markets and then your high-growth markets. And I think we expect that the big investments that we've made in capacity in infrastructure and sales force that we talked about are going to drive a lot of our growth going forward. Ben Wood Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on maybe some of the new restaurant openings you're seeing for your core end customers. Do you guys have an estimate on the pace that you're currently seeing in new restaurant openings? And how does that compare to maybe the current levels? It sounds like Chris has mentioned that it was faster than normal potentially but just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Chris Pappas Yes, again, I think our numbers – we're growing in new markets. So for us it's new accounts, right? So I don't think our systems differentiate between a new customer and a new opening. So I think the numbers are a little fuzzy there. So I think Jim said before, we had 10% increase in customer base overall. So part of that are brand new openings, and part of those are a lot of new customers for Chef. But what I could tell you anecdotally what we've seen is a lot of development. When I look at Florida, we see tremendous development in new neighborhoods new buildings and they're all adding restaurants. And restaurants, I think, our -- how developers use as a reason for someone to come look at their buildings. So I just continue to see as especially in the American market, Dubai, we have tremendous amounts of openings constantly. But in the U.S. market, you kind of see still a shifting of where people are choosing to live. I still don't think we're at the -- what anyone would call normal right? I don't know what normal is anymore. People are working hybrid -- are they all going to come back to the office five days a week? So I think restaurant tours and developers are kind of following the where people are migrating to live and they're building restaurants and they're building apartments and they're building homes. And I don't see that slowing down. I mean anything could happen but I think it's at a pretty healthy pace. Ben Wood Great. Thank you very much. Chris Pappas Thanks, Ben. Operator The next question we have is from Andrew Wolf of C.L. King. Please go ahead. Andrew Wolf Hi. Good morning. thank you. I wanted to ask about margins. First the gross margin at Specialty expanded nicely. I think you said 50 bps and I think it was kind of flattish last quarter. Could you just give us a sense of what accounted for the nice increase in the margin? And is it sort of forward buying inflation back or mix or German or just kind of randomness in the inventory management? And sort of a feeling for sustainability? Chris Pappas Yes. Thanks for the question Andy. I think it just goes back to kind of the improvement we started to drive coming out of the summer last year into September in the fourth quarter. But it's also the fruition of a lot of work that our pricing and procurement teams and our sales management teams have been doing around margin management. We've invested in a lot of tools a lot of technology and a lot of focus on margins after we experienced some of that volatility last year. And that's just continued. And so it's everything from reducing errors in inventory management that lead to waste that impact your margins. It's everything from further integration of our acquisitions and driving the cross-sell. Texas is a good example, as we further integrated our sales teams and our inventory with our CW specialty business and Hardie's the produce business, we've been able to improve overall margins there as we're selling more expensive specialty boxes on their trucks, as we're growing relevance with our customers by having the produce category. And then, obviously it's not specialty related but we invested and built an Allen Brothers processing plant in Texas, and we're selling more expensive protein boxes on those trucks through our processing facility there. So it's really a combination of things and a lot of really good work by a lot of our teams coming together and we're just seeing that continue. Andrew Wolf Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Same question, but looking at the kind of adjusted expense ratio it did expand again but by a little less than last quarter. And obviously, with all the new facilities there's a lot of over -- unabsorbed overhead and maybe even some of the variable costs are obviously maybe not optimized yet. But what is the outlook there? I mean are you going to have slow progress? Is that sort of just a slow and steady as the centers fill up? Or are there other parts of the business where maybe labor inflation or other issues are still kind of impacting overall expense leverage? Chris Pappas No, we talked about it earlier when we did the guidance, Andy. If you recall, the operating leverage is weighted to the back half of the year, mainly the fourth quarter. So, we got a modicum this quarter. We expect a little bit more in Q3 but in Q4, is where we expect because we'll fully lap some of the big facility and the expenses -- the operating expenses that are associated with those big facility investments really in the back half of the year and then into 2025. So, similar to our CapEx is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year because we're finishing those projects. Our operating leverage related to the expenses is weighted towards the back half of the year and the guidance implies that. It's really nothing more than that. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we normally get the most operating leverage just driven by the top line power of the fourth quarter versus really the rest of the year. Andrew Wolf Okay, got it. Thank you. That’s it from me. Chris Pappas Thanks Andy. Operator The next question we have is from Ben Klieve of Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ben Klieve All right. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter here. Jim I had a follow-up question for you. You noted that you are seeing some customers eating nice burgers instead of nice steaks. And I'm wondering if you can comment a bit on kind of the impact of the beef complex on your business, specifically has the kind of persistent increase in beef prices really flowed through your financials as you would expect? And then as the -- and then also looking forward as the price of beef versus other proteins really just continues to widen, is there anything to call out on a forward-looking outlook specifically related to beef? Jim Leddy Well, I mean I think the first thing I would add is that beef prices in general haven't gone up as much as everybody expected. And actually -- while the year-over-year price inflation we reported was about 4%, really it was very -- it was flat versus the first quarter sequentially and fairly flat versus the back half of last year. So, actually a lot of the middle meats and the middle cuts are actually -- prices have been moderating. And even in the last couple of months, even the higher end has moderated a little bit. So, the year-over-year is a little misleading versus what's happening in the market right now. You're not seeing incredible spikes. And I think a lot of that is driven by the fact that retail demand is lower and that really drives the price of beef. Chris Pappas Yes. And I think to add a little bit more color to the -- our customers substituting eating a hamburger versus a steak. Again I mean steakhouses are a small part of our total business. So, steakhouses are a little bit more unique of why customers go to a steakhouse. But we sell so much protein, so much beef to our thousands and thousands of other customers and again they're creative. That's why we have these state-of-the-art cut shops and all the talent that we have to create, whether it's going from a 14-ounce to a 12-ounce type of steak, different types of cuts, how they mix and match their menus. So, it can give maybe a little better value entry point to types of different types of customers. So, we still see a very healthy demand for our prime steaks, our Wagyu steaks, our Japanese steaks. So, the demand is still strong. Is it as strong as it was coming out of COVID? We didn't expect it to be. We think that was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of like big rush everybody going out, and enjoying life again. So I think we're going back to more normalcy. And I've seen these cycles before and that's why, we have five six different types of premium choices for customers and say in our custom grinding operations. And we're also cutting all different types, and maybe smaller-sized portions for customers, who want to keep the quality and maybe lower their price, a few bucks per steak by offering -- you see it on a lot of the menu, a petite filet, or we saw a tremendous amount of obviously skirt steaks and different cuts that fit people's menus. So again, our customer base, which is mainly the independents are extremely creative. And I think, they're going to continue to find ways to get customers in the door and stay profitable and meet a price point that the customer base the date, and time I think with all the media on saying things are changing or economy is slowing, has a kind of effect. But overall, our customer base is really more higher end, and I think it affects them less. Q – Ben Klieve Got it. Got it. Very helpful from both of you. Thanks for the color there. Thanks for taking my question. I'll get back in queue. Chris Pappas Thanks, Ben. Operator Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. And I would like to hand the call back over to Chris Pappas for any closing comments. Chris Pappas Sure. Well, we hope everybody is having a great summer and we thank everybody for joining us on our call, and we look forward for everyone joining on our next quarter. Thank you very much. Jim Leddy Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "title": "All It Takes Is $2,500 Invested in Each of These 3 High-Yield Dow Dividend Stocks to Help Generate Over $300 in Passive Income Per Year",
    "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has 30 industry-leading components that act as representatives of the U.S. economy. The index's rich history has made it a go-to destination for investors looking for quality names that can help them generate dividend income. Over time, the composition of the Dow has changed to reflect the growing influence of technology on the economy, which has helped the Dow produce impressive gains in recent years. But even stodgy Dow names like Coca-Cola , Home Depot , and McDonald's have been roaring higher in recent months and helped the index achieve a fresh all-time high on Oct. 11. Despite the Dow's track record, not every component has a high yield or has been a trustworthy dividend stock. Boeing 's slew of challenges pressured the company to suspend its dividend. Tech stocks like Microsoft , Apple , and Salesforce have yields under 1%, and Amazon doesn't pay dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , Dow (NYSE: DOW) , and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are three of the highest-yielding stocks in the index. Investing $2,500 into each stock produces an average yield of 4.2% and should generate at least $300 in passive income per year. Here's why all three dividend stocks are worth buying now. J&J has dealt with significant challenges over the last few years Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. The company has long been known as a stodgy passive-income powerhouse. But the last few years have been challenging, as reflected in its languishing stock price. J&J was a leader in COVID-19 vaccine developments, which was initially a boon for the company. But rapidly declining demand for the vaccine has been a drag on the company to the point where J&J now reports many of its results as \"excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine.\" Another challenge has been adjusting to the spinoff of J&J's consumer health business, which occurred in August 2023. Former J&J brands, such as Band-Aid and Tylenol, are now under the new entity Kenvue . The spinoff should help J&J be a faster-growing company by focusing on just two segments -- Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, it does remove some of the safe and stodgy parts of the business that made J&J a rock-solid dividend stock, no matter the economic cycle. Finally, J&J has been dealing with lawsuits that allege its talc-based products led to cancer development. J&J restructured and made a subsidiary called Red River Talc LLC, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sept. 20 to handle current and future claims. After a messy few years, J&J is finally ready to turn the corner. The business has been putting up solid results and growing at a rate that should support good, if not excellent, dividend raises going forward. J&J generates a ton of free cash flow that easily covers its dividend expense. And with a yield of 3.1%, J&J stands out compared to the S&P 500 dividend yield of just 1.2%. Dow is a coiled spring for economic growth Not to be confused with the \"Dow\" in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow makes chemicals used in plastics, seals, foams, gels, adhesives, resins, coatings, and more. The commodity chemical company has three key segments -- Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, and Performance Materials & Coatings. Dow's business model is capital intensive and vulnerable to ebbs and flows in global demand and supply. Dow has been hit hard by volume declines and lower margins. In the following chart, you can see that revenue and margins surged in 2021 and early 2022 but have fallen considerably since then. Similarly, the stock price has gone practically nowhere since the spinoff. Dow has blamed macroeconomic factors as a key reason for its weak results. However, low interest rates could greatly benefit many of the company's end markets. For example, lower mortgage interest rates could boost housing demand, which would help Dow's polyurethanes and construction chemicals business. Lower interest rates could also boost demand for durable goods. Overall, Dow is well positioned to see a sizable uptick in earnings next year. Analyst consensus estimates call for just $2.26 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2024 but $3.55 in 2025 EPS. Although Dow looks expensive based on trailing earnings, it would have a far more reasonable valuation if it delivers on expectations. Despite the volatility of Dow's performance, it has proven to be a reliable income stock spinning off from DowDuPont in 2019. Dow yields 5.2%, making it the second-highest yielding stock in the Dow Jones, behind only Verizon Communications . Dow hasn't raised its payout since the spinoff, but it has incorporated stock repurchases as part of its capital return program. The company's goal is to return 65% of earnings to shareholders through buybacks and dividends so it has enough dry powder to fund long-term investments in new production plans, low-carbon efforts, and more. Overall, Dow is a good value stock for income investors to consider now. A quality energy stock with a high yield Like Dow, Chevron can be a highly cyclical business whose results are heavily impacted by commodity prices. But Chevron has a strong balance sheet, a diversified upstream business that doesn't depend on one production region, a massive refining business, and a track record for raising its dividend no matter what oil prices are doing. In fact, Chevron has paid and raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. Chevron yields 4.3%, which is the third-highest yield in the Dow Jones. The company's track record for dividend raises, paired with its high yield, makes it arguably the single best passive income play out of the 30 Dow components. Investors worried about declining oil prices can take solace in knowing that Chevron has a large margin for error in supporting its dividend. Chevron's capital expenditures and buybacks are near five-year highs. If oil prices tank, Chevron can simply pause buybacks and pull back on capital expenditures. Chevron didn't cut its dividend when oil prices crashed in 2020, so it stands to reason that it would take a prolonged downturn for the company even to consider reducing its payout. Chevron stands out as a balanced buy for investors looking for a safer way to invest in oil and gas and power their passive income stream. Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?

    "title": "Lutsen Lodge: Destroyed by fire, scorched by controversy",
    "text": "LUTSEN — A fire Feb. 6 destroyed the state’s oldest operating resort, the historic Lutsen Lodge, leaving only memories of what once was a place of celebration, gathering and tradition for guests. Bryce Campbell, the colorful and controversial owner since 2018, has vowed to rebuild the lodge. But will insurance cover millions of dollars in damages? Whether this northern Minnesota gem will return is uncertain as the State Fire Marshal's investigation continues. Campbell’s grandiose vision for the lodge was unraveling for some time before a fire resulted in its complete loss. According to public records from the State of Minnesota and Cook County, the multimillion-dollar plan was plagued by Minnesota liquor tax delinquencies, state fees for unpermitted work, unresolved fire code violations and multiple lawsuits in Minnesota District Court from contractors, employees and property owners who say they were never paid. Is it unreasonable to expect the Lutsen Resort to rise from the ashes, despite his promise to rebuild? Campbell didn’t respond to the News Tribune’s multiple requests for an interview for this story. ADVERTISEMENT Campbell, 39, is the owner of North Shore Resort Co., which falls under the Campbell Hospitality Group, an Ontario-based company he founded with his late mother, Sheila Campbell. In 2001, Campbell and his mother bought the Reston Creemee Drive-In in Manitoba, Canada. It was sold in 2013. In 2007, Campbell Hospitality Group bought Main Street Inn and Suites and Rest’n Inn, both in Manitoba. According to Empire Advance, a Manitoba-based weekly publication, both properties were renovated under the Campbells’ ownership. On July 22, 2010, a kitchen fire at the Rest'n Inn caused irreparable damage to the hotel, according to the Reston Recorder, a since-closed newspaper in Manitoba. At the time, Pipestone-Albert Fire Department Chief Jack Berry told the Recorder that the fire commissioner believed the incident was caused by a faulty electrical system in the grill area. According to the Office of the Fire Commissioner’s report, it appeared the fire originated from a deep-fat fryer and was deemed accidental. Rest’n Inn also included two restaurants: Brycington’s and Aurora Bar & Grill. Eighteen employees were displaced after the fire and the Campbells sold the hotel in 2014. The four-unit Main Street Inn and Suites, still owned by Campbell, is home to three apartments/condos and a chiropractic clinic. Campbell Hospitality Group acquired the Roadrunner Motel in Rainy River, Ontario, in 2010. The Campbells planned to physically relocate six of its 18 units to the Rest’n Inn in Manitoba. ADVERTISEMENT The motel was renamed “Walla Walla Inn” and reopened in 2011 with the help of Patti Diebel and her parents, John and Mary Sanderson, according to the Rainy River Record newspaper. Rainy River town records show that Campbell sold the Walla Walla Inn in early 2022 to 13805921 Canada Inc., a federally incorporated business. In February 2014, Campbell Hospitality Group bought the 70-room Copper River Inn and Event Centre in Fort Frances, Ontario, with the help of the Rainy River Future Development Corp. and two other lenders. The Copper River Inn underwent a complete remodel with plans to reopen in March 2014, according to the Fort Frances Times. The addition of the inn's new Copper Taphouse and Grill opened in June 2018. Campbell told the Northern Ontario Business news site that the hospitality group invested $3 million into the inn’s renovations, earning him recognition from the Fort Frances Chamber of Commerce as 2015 Entrepreneur of the Year. Under Campbell’s ownership, the Copper River Inn and Event Centre were involved in several lawsuits with the United Food and Commercial Workers Canada Local 175. The union holds bargaining rights for the inn’s housekeeping, hospitality and front desk employees. A court board had dismissed two applications, on March 28, 2017, and March 9, 2018, to decertify the union. These efforts followed the filing of two lawsuits by the union involving cases where two probationary employees at the inn were both found to be wrongfully terminated by Arbitrator Dana Randall in Ontario Court of Justice . On Dec. 19, 2016, a 17-year-old probationary employee was wrongfully terminated after reporting workplace harassment, according to Ontario Court of Justice. A second grievance was filed Feb. 17, 2017, regarding the same employee, who alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a hotel guest on Nov. 6, 2016. Both grievances were awarded by arbitration on May 17, 2019, including $1,000 in damages regarding the employer’s failure to respond to the sexual assault allegations, according to the law, and compensation for lost wages. ADVERTISEMENT The case regarding the employer’s response to the sexual assault allegations was raised again in Ontario Superior Court of Justice Divisional Court . On July 19, 2021, the court ruled in favor of the union, which claimed the awarded damages were not enough, for a new hearing to be held before a new arbitrator, as well as awarding it $10,000 in associated costs. On April 27, 2018, Copper River Inn employee Cindy Baker slipped and fell at work during her fourth probationary shift and suffered a significant Workplace Safety and Insurance Board-recognized injury. Baker was paid for three weeks of lost employment and returned to work with restrictions. Originally hired as a part-time employee, Baker was then scheduled for a 48-hour workweek. After Baker complained to her supervisor, she was still required to work the hours, which resulted in “agonizing pain” and immobility. On June 15, 2018, the Safety and Insurance Board instructed Baker to undergo an appointment, which determined she could return to work with numerous physical restrictions and with modified shifts limited to four hours. This was not accommodated by the employer, according to Ontario Court of Justice. Then, according to Ontario Court of Justice, Baker was wrongfully terminated June 19, 2018, at the direction of Campbell. On Nov. 9, 2020, Ontario Court of Justice ruled in favor of the union on a damage award of $20,000 in Baker’s case. Randall stated in the arbitration decision that Baker “had to put up with being portrayed as lacking charisma and flair in circumstances where she was fighting through pain that the employer willfully turned a blind eye.” Under oath, Campbell said employees were upset that the union was spending their dues on arbitration. According to Ontario court documents, Board Vice Chair Mary Anne McKellar found that Campbell “either did not appreciate or did not care what representative authority the union held with respect to the employees.” The court document also alleged that under Campbell’s management, the hotel was “chronically delinquent” in forwarding membership documentation to the union for new hires, and in forwarding dues it had remitted. ADVERTISEMENT Further, McKellar stated, “The facts of this case support an inference that Mr. Campbell either was behind the initiation of the termination campaign, or that he created a climate in the workplace in which employees would perceive that a (union) termination application was desirable.” In 2018, the Campbells purchased the Lutsen Resort. That August, Campbell took out mortgages on Lutsen Resort with Republic Bank, Inc. for $4.73 million and from North Shore Land Co. for $675,000, which matured in July 2023. At that time, there were 150 employees, previous owners Scott Harrison and Nancy Burns stated during an interview with the WTIP radio station. Then, the Campbells bought Superior Shores in Two Harbors from Joe Re on Jan. 1, 2020, for nearly $15 million. The record-high resort sale included 131 of the total 184 units of its lodge, lakehomes and Burlington Bay condos, according to Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal. While Campbell's Canadian businesses were reported to have suffered greatly during the pandemic, he said his Minnesota businesses thrived — thanks to Twin Cities tourists, according to an article titled \"COVID-19 recovery vastly different in Canada vs. the U.S.\" published Sept. 16, 2020, in the Fort Francis Times. Meanwhile, Campbell said the programs offered by the federal and provincial governments during COVID-19 covered half of his losses. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, North Shore Resort Co. received over $1.8 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans between 2020 and 2021, retaining roughly 130 jobs. In 2021, Bryce Campbell served as treasurer of Visit Cook County Board of Directors. He was appointed to a three-year term by the Lutsen-Tofte-Schroeder Tourism Association. On Aug. 12, 2021, Sheila Campbell died. She and her husband, Kendon Campbell, operated a 600-acre cattle farm near Reston. ADVERTISEMENT The Campbells planned to transform Lutsen Resort into a luxury boutique lodge with the addition of a $4 million Nordic spa. During the Cook County Board of Commissioners meeting Dec. 17, 2019, Campbell expressed concern that a newly proposed tax classification of short-term rental properties would impact his investments, such as the development of the spa, which he planned to submit building applications for the following year. Campbell told commissioners he needed the ability for 60% occupancy on the property, but under the proposed classification, most of the resort's units would be limited to 50% occupancy. In that case, Campbell said he would move the spa to Two Harbors. A conditional use permit application dated July 11, 2023, for the proposed Nordic spa stated it would replace the resort's saunas, hot tubs and pools. Upon review of the permit application, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources recommended denial, citing concerns about the potential of runoff contamination into the Poplar River and Lake Superior. The DNR also noted that changing the area’s topography would negatively impact the environment. Lutsen Resort’s lodge was located at the mouth of the Poplar River and Lake Superior. It hosted lodging, two restaurants, events, a pool and massage services, and nearby on-site housing for its staff. Its eastern property boundary is the Poplar River, which hosts the Poplar River Condo Association on the opposite shoreline. To the west is the Lutsen Resort Townhome Association, under separate ownership. Several nearby property owners heavily scrutinized plans to expand the resort. Cook County received numerous letters of opposition. On Aug. 9, 2023, Campbell appeared before the Cook County Board of Adjustment to request a variance for an expansion of the Lutsen Lodge and for the construction of a separate three-story, 32-rental unit chalet. The proposed construction of the spa would have included the removal of the bluff north of the parking lot. The request was tabled, pending completion of an Environmental Assessment Worksheet. ADVERTISEMENT The following month, Campbell hired McMillan Tree Service to clear trees in this area. At the Board of Adjustment meeting Aug. 9, 2023, Campbell requested a variance to replace the pedestrian bridge destroyed by the Poplar River flood in 2022. However, there would be no pedestrian easement. \"It's always been a viewing bridge more than an actual accessory bridge,” Campbell said. The bridge request was approved under conditions that the resort obtain the proper permits from the Department of Natural Resources and the Army Corps of Engineers and an easement agreement from the Poplar River Ridge Condominium Association. During the planning commission's public hearing, Ann Sullivan, ex-officio planning commission member and county commissioner, commented publicly as a private citizen, stating that in addition to the Environmental Assessment Worksheet, she believed the issues with the resort’s prior public waters violation with the DNR should be resolved. Sullivan was referring to the cease-and-desist order that was issued by the DNR to Lutsen Resort on Sept. 7, 2022, to halt unpermitted work on the pedestrian bridge on the Poplar River during fish spawning season. Two days later, the DNR authorized limited emergency work, which expired Sept. 15, 2022. However, a DNR officer observed ongoing work that was beyond the limited emergency authorization and ordered all work stopped at that time. The investigation into this matter is ongoing by the Minnesota DNR, Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to Gail Nosek, DNR communications director. Grand Portage Reservation Water Quality Specialist Margaret Watkins also voiced concern about the resort's application to place a salt spa next to a trout stream without a plan for wastewater treatment. \"(Bryce) had a very specific vision on how he wanted things done, and it was not necessarily in line with the market that's in this direct area,\" said Quinton McCorquodale, former facilities director for Lutsen Resort's housekeeping and maintenance department. McCorquodale was hired Oct. 3, 2022. \"It was significantly slower than other properties that I've worked in this field,\" he said. He was among other employees laid off after the fire. McCorquodale claimed Campbell was marketing the resort to “DINKS,” an expression referring to households with “dual income, no kids.” “The majority of business in Lutsen prior to that had been kind of built on the Duluth area and locals,” McCorquodale said. “With the loss of that, he was not able to pull in as many people from Minneapolis as he had relied on.\" Former staff members recounted that just months before the fire, Campbell changed the menu at The Strand, a high-end restaurant in the main lodge, to a single five-course meal option at $125 a person. \"I effectively saw the dining room almost dead in a month or so,\" McCorquodale said. Alex Hilterbrand was hired by Lutsen Resort in January 2023. \"I had responded to a recreation manager position,” she said. “They put me at the front desk.” In her position, Hilterbrand said she fielded many calls from people complaining that the resort was \"pushing out the community.\" \"Neither Edward nor Bryce are from the North Shore area,” Hilterbrand said. “They were trying to turn the resort into something that didn't really match the vibe of what the people of Minnesota are like.” From $3,000 bottles of wine to charging roughly $1,000 for a three-night stay, several residents, longtime guests and staff claimed the resort was out of touch with the local hospitality market, Hilterbrand said. Further, Hilterbrand described the resort's employee residences as being \"disgusting\" and \"moldy,\" with one of the two buildings having a cockroach infestation. Improper inspection and maintenance was also alleged to be the root of a 2022 personal injury lawsuit filed with Minnesota's Sixth Judicial District Court on July 20, 2022, by a guest, Jessica Meli, who was significantly injured Dec. 24, 2020, due to icy parking lot conditions at the resort. Hilterbrand quit after five months working for the resort due to the working environment. She now works for the Virginia Parks and Recreation Department. \"I knew in my heart of hearts working there that something was going on below the surface,\" Hilterbrand said. \"And I just couldn't put my finger on it.\" According to McCorquodale, he began covering the front desk after Hilterbrand quit. “It was just a slow attrition and we didn't have the finances to replace those people,” McCorquodale said. Staff and residents have raised questions about the drowning death of 20-year-old Saunder Strong. Strong was hired as a dishwasher and was later offered a position as an activities guide for summer 2023. Given her past experience as a park ranger, naturalist and outdoor educator with a degree in wilderness management and recreation programming, as well as a two-year certification in backcountry guiding, Hilterbrand believed Strong was unqualified. \"Mind you, people from the Twin Cities, they're a little bit different from the people up north in that a lot of them don't have the outdoor experience to really know what they're contending with when it comes to the cold, the lack of service, how harsh and unforgiving being outdoors can be,\" Hilterbrand said. She recalled warning Strong on May 9, 2023, about the dangers of whitewater kayaking during snowmelt runoff season. Later that afternoon, the resort's accountant, Kay Spielman, died in what is said to be a freak accident when a rock went through her windshield while she was driving near Two Harbors. \"The interesting thing is we only really acknowledge Saunder's death,\" Hilterbrand said. \"After that, it was really just like, 'Leave it alone. We don't talk about it again. We're going to move on.' \" In July 2023, Campbell reportedly put the Superior Shores Burlington Bay condos on the market, offering a $100,000 Home Depot or Wayfair gift card to the first 20 buyers to close on a condo before September of that year. On Nov. 20, 2023, Superior Shores condo unit owner David Kuiti, of Hermantown, initiated a civil lawsuit with the State of Minnesota's Sixth Judicial District Court in Lake County for over $100,000 against North Shore Resort Co. containing three counts: tortious interference with a business opportunity, willful breach of fiduciary obligation and duty to act in good faith, and civil theft. According to the court document filed on March 12, after Kuiti refused to sell his condo unit to Campbell at a price significantly lower than its market value, Campbell, serving as president of the Superior Shores II Condominium Association, removed the unit from the rental pool. Kuiti went on to act as his own rental lease agent and alleged that Campbell, through his employees and agents, “continued a pattern of harassment” by refusing to allow reasonable access to renters of Kuiti’s property, according to the lawsuit. A court case involving the operation of Superior Shores is ongoing in Lake County. In March, the nearby Lutsen Resort also suffered a significant revenue loss when it offloaded the Poplar River Condos in what McCorquodale described as a “semi-amicable split” in partnership with the homeowners association. In fall 2023, HOA members of Cliffhouse Townhomes and Lutsen Log Cabins, managed by Lutsen Resort, claimed they began seeing payments lapse even as their properties had bookings. Cabin owner Bob Nagel is among the 10 vacation rental property owners who filed individual lawsuits in Sixth District Court against North Shore Resort Co. for non-payments from around August through December 2023. “About five years ago or so, Bryce took it over,” Nagel said. “It wasn't very long afterwards the payments would be late and late and late. There were just all kinds of excuses. They wouldn't answer the phones. They wouldn't answer emails. Eventually, then you would get paid.\" Since the News Tribune last reported on Lutsen Resort’s lawsuits with various rental property owners in February, six more Cliffhouse Townhome owners filed conciliation court claims. North Shore Resort Co. submitted a motion to dismiss each of the overall nine claims, arguing that the property owners had no legal right to an individual claim as members of larger homeowners associations. The court ruled against North Shore Resort Co. in eight of the conciliation cases on April 28, totaling $113,792. One of the property owners voluntarily dismissed his case at the advice of his attorney. \"Let's say you have something inside that needs to be replaced,” Nagel explained of the property management arrangement. “You're supposed to be able to call him. Then he goes out and finds people to do it, and he bills you for it.” Cliffhouse Townhomes, Lutsen Log Cabins and Poplar River Condos, all previously managed by Lutsen Resort, switched to Cascade Vacation Rentals, a separate North Shore property management company unaffiliated with Campbell, by the end of 2023. Lutsen Sea Villas, which broke ties with Lutsen Resort three years ago, is now managed by Odyssey Resorts. The dwindling number of guests at the resort and restaurant had become apparent to the public. Revenue declined and debt continued to mount for the resort as contractors, concessionaires and employees alleged they went unpaid: In addition, several contractors filed mechanic's liens: \"There's an overall lack of revenue,” McCorquodale recalled. “(Bryce) blamed winter for it, but it was more so his decision-making process.\" When the resort’s management staff were notified that it would run out of payroll in six weeks, McCorquodale said he began seeking employment elsewhere. “I asked when we were going to tell the front-line employees. Edward said to hold off on that and to trust him,” McCorquodale said. A series of emails provided to the News Tribune offers insight into the level of awareness that the resort’s management, accounting department, owner and staff had regarding the strenuous financial circumstances in the days leading up to the fire. On Feb. 1, 2024, Vanegas emailed Campbell to notify him the resort couldn't fund payroll for the period ending Feb. 4. “We need to let our company’s managers and line staff know what’s about to happen and how we can assist them with new employment, continued housing in the interim and transportation to the airport and bus stations they might need,” Vanegas wrote to Campbell. “We must suspend guest arrivals and suspend accepting reservations.” Vanegas warned Campbell that failure to disclose the payroll situation to staff and any work past Sunday could result in a Minnesota labor law violation. Vanegas encouraged Campbell to consider the National Bank of Commerce’s offer of $500,000 in funding, subtracting the mechanic's liens, for a net of $150,000 to cover one and a half payroll periods. On Feb. 1, Lutsen Resort Accounting Director Donna McCurdy-Wolke said in an email to Vanegas that she expected a negative balance in the coming days due to automatic fees. Vanegas responded that weekend food and beverage sales might cover both of their paychecks and indicated that Campbell was aware there was no bank balance. In a Feb. 2 email, Vanegas instructed McCorquodale not to “continue to advance a resort closing/lose all of our jobs/ missed payroll agenda” to staff or managers as it would be “premature.” That day, Campbell emailed the accounting department, encouraging them to “ride out this abnormal season and focus on a busy upcoming summer.” In that email, Campbell said there would be no final winter marketing push to fill March bookings. The resort would instead switch to “waterfall marketing” — tourism promotions aimed at attracting guests to the local waterfalls — to fill rooms for April and May. In a Monday, Feb. 5, email, Vanegas notified the accounting department that he had suspended Sysco orders for the week. McCurdy-Wolke responded that Campbell would meet with bankers in two days and expected there would be enough funds to cover payroll that Friday. “We are providing a tour for three senior executives from NBC Bank on Wednesday afternoon and they have expressed a need to audit Accounts Payable for Lutsen Lodge,” Vanegas wrote in an email to the accounting department. McCurdy-Wolke responded that an account review would reveal, “We haven’t paid bills in months.” Vanegas suggested suspending direct deposits and allowing paychecks to be written to buy time for accounts to come through. McCorquodale said he asked Campbell in person about his plan to take out a bank loan to secure payroll. McCorquodale said Campbell assured him he would be paid. McCorquodale later notified Vanegas he received a job offer elsewhere. “That evening, it all just went up,” McCorquodale said. After the initial 911 call the morning of the fire Tuesday, Feb. 6, McCorquodale said the resort’s night auditor, Tyler Cobb, called him at 12:36 a.m. During a previous interview with the News Tribune, Vanegas identified the reporting party as Tyler Standley. “(Tyler) said that there was smoke coming up from the floorboards around the electrical outlet,\" McCorquodale said. \"So he had gone downstairs and he had gone to the laundry room. The basement's actually split into two parts and the laundry room. There was no fire there or no smoke.\" McCorquodale claimed to be the second person on the scene, arriving after the Cook County Sheriff’s Office. He saw smoke coming from the lodge’s lobby area, starting directly above the water heater. The fire spread laterally through the staircase, McCorquodale said. Since the fire, McCorquodale spoke several times to agents from Ember Investigations, a Brule-based certified fire investigator specializing in fire causation. He said they seem to be particularly interested in the lodge’s water heater. Vanegas declined to comment due to the ongoing insurance investigation. The state fire marshal has not yet released a conclusion of its investigation.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD - Ambassador of Rwanda to Pakistan, Ms Fatou Harerimana, on Sunday, said that bilateral cooperation between Rwanda and Pakistan in the health sector and public health is inevitable and there is potential on both sides in this sector. There is a need to further increase the bilateral economic and trade relations between Pakistan and Rwanda, for which the role of the private sector from both sides is very important, the ambassador said and added that Pakistan and Rwanda enjoy friendly relations underpinned by mutual respect, growing economic ties and cooperation at multilateral fora. Rwanda and Pakistan, with a longstanding relationship spanning sixty-two years, actively collaborate in various fields, including trade, health, and investment, she remarked. She said that Rwanda’s real GDP of Rwanda grew by 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2024, exceeding the previous year’s growth rate of 8.2 percent and the country has shown remarkable resilience, driven by strong consumer spending in key sectors such as services and industry. The ambassador said that despite ongoing challenges, Rwanda’s labour market experienced a strong recovery, with over half a million new jobs created in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking the most significant reduction in unemployment since the COVID pandemic. The labour market expansion in Rwanda was broad-based, with women benefiting slightly more than men and to leverage its youth demographic, Rwanda needs to expand labour force participation, as only 2.8 million out of 8.1 million working age individuals are employed full time. People of Sindh rejected PTI’s protest call: Nasir Shah She said that Rwanda aspires to become a Middle-Income Country by 2035 and a High-Income Country by 2050. It plans to achieve this through the implementation of the second National Strategies for Transformation (NST-2), a five year-development agenda underpinned by sectoral strategies focused on meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Updating on the economy, she said that Rwanda’s economy continued to stage a strong growth in the first half of 2024 and after growing by an average of 8.2 percent in 2022-2023, real GDP increased by 9.7 percent in the first half of 2024. The GDP growth is expected to maintain momentum in 2025–26, with a projected average of 7.7 percent, to a recovery in global tourism, new construction projects, and manufacturing activities, she added. CEO of GAK HealthCare International, Dr Akbar Niazi Teaching Hospital, and Islamabad Medical and Dental College, Yasir Khan Niazi said that Pakistan and Rwanda have huge potential in public health sector and they are ready to work and increase bilateral cooperation in this area. Yasir Khan said that Rwanda is a growing economy in the African region where there is immense potential in the health sector.

    "title": "Ringgit closes slightly higher against US dollar on weaker US data",
    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit rose marginally against the greenback today as the US Dollar Index (DXY) declined due to weaker United States (US) economic data. At 6.01 pm, the ringgit stood at 4.7055/7105 versus the US dollar compared with last Friday's close of 4.7065/7110. Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the US nonfarm payrolls for May was revised downwards last week from 272,000 to 218,000, suggesting that the US labour market may not be entirely robust. Although the labour force participation rate was slightly higher to 62.6 per cent in June compared with 62.5 per cent in May, it was still lower than the 62.7 per cent achieved during March and April this year, he said. At the same time, Mohd Afzanizam noted, the US is steadily witnessing an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.1 per cent in June from 3.9 per cent and 4.0 per cent in April and May, respectively. Hence, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to the US Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday this week is quite critical as market participants would be searching for any clue of easing biases, he told Bernama. \"In the grand scheme of things, disinflation trend has emerged while growth appears to be softening. Therefore, the case to pivot towards a more accommodative monetary stance could be warranted to ensure economic growth would be supported. \"Against such a backdrop, the ringgit does look constructive to end the year at RM4.65,” Mohd Afzanizam said. Meanwhile, at the close, the ringgit traded mainly higher against a basket of major currencies. It appreciated against the Japanese yen to 2.9219/9252 from 2.9286/9315 at Friday’s close and edged up vis-a-vis the euro to 5.0923/0977 from 5.0953/1001 at the end of last week, but was easier versus the British pound to 6.0273/0337 from 6.0182/0240 previously. The ringgit traded mainly weaker against its ASEAN peers. It strengthened versus the Singapore dollar to 3.4848/4887 from 3.4876/4912 at Friday’s close. However, the local note eased against the Indonesian rupiah to 289.4/290.0 from 289.1/289.5 at the previous close, fell versus the Thai baht to 12.9268/9456 from 12.8646/881 last Friday, and slipped against the Philippine peso to 8.05/8.06 from 8.04/8.05. - Bernama",

    "title": "Kapil Wadhawan moves NCLAT against Union Bank's insolvency plea over ₹3,958-crore default",
    "text": "New Delhi: Kapil Wadhawan, the former promoter of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to challenge the initiation of personal insolvency proceedings against him by Union Bank of India for a ₹ 3,958-crore default. The NCLAT heard the case briefly on Monday before it deferred the matter to 18 July without issuing a notice. On 2 April, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) accepted Union Bank's application to begin insolvency resolution proceedings against Wadhawan. On 20 March, the NCLT had admitted a similar application against his brother and co-promoter Dheeraj Wadhawan. DHFL had taken various term loans exceeding ₹ 4,000 crore and working-capital loans worth ₹ 450 crore. Kapil Wadhawan had provided unconditional and irrevocable guarantees for these loans from Union Bank and other lenders. Also read: Personal guarantors in the crosshairs as lenders step up heat to receover dues In response to the bank’s insolvency plea, Wadhawan argued he had signed a joint deed of guarantee in favour of Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd, a trustee that had been appointed by a consortium of 29 banks. Wadhawan contended that because the security trustee was designated by the consortium to accept securities and secure loans for DHFL, individual lenders within the consortium did not have the authority to approach the tribunal directly. The trustee held these securities in trust for the consortium's benefit, he argued, and questioned the individual lender's ability to independently initiate legal proceedings. However, the tribunal disregarded this argument, noting that the term 'banks' should be interpreted broadly to encompass individual financial institutions as well. The tribunal added that to enforce the guarantee, a specific bank could pursue the guarantor as if he were the primary debtor Increased scrutiny on personal guarantors The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of DHFL on 20 November 2019 and appointed R Subramaniakumar as the company's administrator. Then in September 2021, Piramal Capital acquired DHFL for ₹ 34,250 crore , merging it with its operations. This case highlights the increasing scrutiny on personal guarantors following a Supreme Court ruling on 9 November 2023 that upheld crucial provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The court denied relief to a group of personal guarantors, including those challenging sections 95 to 100 of the IBC, reinforcing their accountability for defaulted debts. Also read: What the Subhash Chandra case means for personal guarantors Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act 2018 and subsequent notifications, personal guarantors are directly subject to insolvency proceedings without creditors having to pursue action against the corporate debtor first.",

    "text": "Asian shares have rallied after a benign reading on US inflation restored some hope for further policy easing next year, amid relief that Washington has averted a government shutdown. After the bonanza of recent central bank decisions, this week is much quieter with only the minutes of a few of those meetings due. There are no Federal Reserve speeches and US data is of secondary importance. Otherwise the themes were largely the same on Monday, with the dollar underpinned by a relatively strong economy and higher bond yields, which in turn is a burden for commodities and gold. It is also a headache for emerging market countries, which are having to intervene to stop their currencies from falling too far and stoking domestic inflation. For now, the afterglow from the US inflation report was enough to lift MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 per cent. Japan's Nikkei gained 0.7 per cent and South Korea firmed 0.9 per cent. S&P 500 futures added 0.3 per cent, while Nasdaq futures firmed 0.4 per cent. The S&P 500 fell almost 2 per cent last week and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent, though the latter is still up 30 per cent for the year. Analysts at BofA noted the S&P 500 was up 23 per cent for the year, but if the 12 largest companies were excluded the gain was only 8 per cent. They cautioned such extreme concentration was a vulnerability going into 2025. Wall Street had rallied on Friday when a key gauge of core US inflation printed lower than expected at 0.11 per cent, providing a partial antidote to the Fed's hawkishness earlier in the week. Fed funds futures rallied to imply a 53 per cent chance of a rate cut in March and 62 per cent for May, though they only have two quarter-point easings to 3.75-4.0 per cent priced in for all of 2025. A few months ago, the market had hoped rates would bottom around 3.0 per cent. The prospect of fewer cuts has combined with expectations of more debt-funding government spending to pressure bond markets, with 10-year yields surging almost 42 basis points in just two weeks for the biggest such increase since April 2022. \"The recent firming in core inflation has interacted with a rising threat of tariffs and immigration restrictions to temper the Fed's inflation optimism,\" noted JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli. \"Given our inflation and unemployment rate forecasts, we continue to look for 75bp of cuts next year with a hold in January and a quarterly cadence thereafter.\" In currency markets, the dollar index held near two-year highs at 107.970 having climbed 1.9 per cent for the month so far. The euro looked vulnerable at $1.0432 having again tested support around $1.0331 last week. The dollar was firm at 156.44, having gained 4.5 per cent so far in December, but faces more threats of Japanese intervention should it challenge the 160.00 barrier. The strong dollar combined with high bond yields to weigh on gold, which stood at $US2,624 ($A4,197) an ounce after slipping one per cent last week. The high dollar is also a burden for oil, already hampered by concerns over Chinese demand following dismal retail sales figures last week. Brent was up four cents at $US73.00 ($A116.76) a barrel, while US crude gained 12 cents to $US69.58 ($A111.29) per barrel.",

    "title": "Federal government raises N374.751 billion from August bond auction on renewed investors’ demand",
    "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has raised N374.751 billion in its August 2024 FGN bond auction. This is according to the auction result released by the Debt Management Office (DMO) on its website. After about three months of declining allotments, the total amount allotted in August 2024 was 66.05% higher than the N225.714 billion recorded in the previous month . Related Stories FG issues $500 million five-year domestic dollar bond at 9.75% Nigeria to issue $500 million domestic dollar bond on Monday Although there was a 36.67% decline in total bond offer to N190 billion for the August auction, total subscription surged by 64.57% to N460.182 billion. The auction, held on August 19, 2024, attracted strong interest from investors, showing a renewed demand for government debt instruments, particularly those with longer tenors. Investors’ continued interest towards longer tenors in August drove the overall higher subscription levels. This auction featured three distinct bonds with tenors of 5 years, 7 years, and 9 years, marking a critical moment in Nigeria’s efforts to secure funding for ongoing national projects. 19.30% FGN APR 2029: The 5-year bond, offering a coupon rate of 19.30%, received a lukewarm response from investors, with a subscription level of only N24.349 billion, significantly below the offered amount of N70 billion. As a result, N18.349 billion was allotted at a marginal rate of 20.30%. This undersubscription by 65.22% suggests that investors are less interested in shorter-tenor bonds, likely due to their lower yield and shorter duration. 18.50% FGN FEB 2031: The 7-year bond saw moderate interest from investors, with a subscription of N60.750 billion, just shy of the offered amount of N70 billion. Ultimately, N42.189 billion was allotted at a marginal rate of 20.90%. This bond, with a coupon rate of 18.50%, was undersubscribed by 13.21%, indicating a fair level of confidence in medium-term government securities, though not as robust as the demand for longer tenors. 19.89% FGN MAY 2033: The 9-year bond emerged as the clear favourite among investors, with a subscription of N375.083 billion, despite the lower offered amount of N50 billion. The bond was allotted N314.213 billion at a marginal rate of 21.50%, reflecting a significant oversubscription of 650.17%. This bond’s appeal lies in its longer tenor and higher yield, which appear to align with investors’ strategies to secure higher returns in a potentially volatile economic environment. Demand for FGN bonds declined for three months, from May to July 2024. However, there appears to be renewed demand based on the auction result for August 2024. As usual, there is a clear investor preference for longer-term bonds, as evidenced by the overwhelming subscription to the 9-year bond. This preference may be driven by a desire to lock in higher yields over an extended period, particularly in the face of potential inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties. On the other hand, the lower subscription rates for the 5-year and 7-year bonds suggest that investors are more cautious about committing funds to shorter-term instruments. The marginal rates—ranging from 20.30% for the 5-year bond to 21.50% for the 9-year bond—indicate that the government is willing to offer competitive returns to attract funding. Moreover, the success of this auction provides the government with a critical infusion of funds, which can be directed toward infrastructure development, debt servicing, and other essential national projects. It also signals to the market that Nigeria remains an attractive destination for investment, even as it navigates complex economic challenges.",

    "title": "Champagne stays put as Liberals name new FedDev, PrairiesCan ministers in cabinet shuffle",
    "text": "Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Francois-Philippe Champagne is not part of today’s cabinet shuffle as a new year election looks near-certain. Shuffle caps off a hectic week kicked off by the resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. Champagne has been serving as Innovation Minister , when he took over from Navdeep Bains. The shuffle named eight news MPs to cabinet, replacing some ministers who have resigned or made it known they will not be seeking re-election in recent weeks, while four got new or modified portfolios. The shuffle includes new ministers responsible for a pair of regional development agencies that fund technology projects in Canada. Brampton North MP Ruby Sahota is the new Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), replacing Filomena Tassi who in October that she will not seek re-election. Sahota re-affirmed her support for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday after an in reaction to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s surprise . Additionally, Winnipeg South MP Terry Duguid is replacing Dan Vandal as the new Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan). Vandal also his retirement from politics in October. The shuffle caps off a hectic week leading up to the holidays, kicked off by Freeland’s resignation from her position Monday hours before she was scheduled to deliver the Fall Economic Statement (FES). In her departing statement, Freeland noted that she has been at odds with Trudeau lately regarding the best path forward for Canada at a time when the country faces “a grave challenge” from the United States. After hours of uncertainty, chaos, and no finance minister, House Leader Karina Gould tabled the FES just after 4 p.m. on Monday. Less than an hour later, then-Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs, Dominic LeBlanc, had Finance added to his portfolio. LeBlanc retained the finance portfolio in the shuffle, but Ottawa South MP David McGuinty took the Public Safety portfolio off his plate. Leblanc will now be the one responsible for following through on a in the FES aimed at spurring more investment in Canada’s technology sector and domestic businesses more broadly. This a renewal of the Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative (VCCI), Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credit reform, programs to encourage more private investment in mid-cap growth firms and pension fund support for artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. There are also measures named in the that LeBlanc will now have to see through, such as the capital gains tax changes that Canadian tech earlier this year, that . However, many promises contained within the FES require legislative amendment, making them unlikely to be fulfilled after NDP leader Jagmeet Singh released a announcing his intention to file a non-confidence motion when the House of Commons sits again on Jan. 27, 2025. The NDP has long propped up the Liberal minority government, the Conservative Party’s non-confidence motions throughout the year despite the in September. Without the NDP’s support, an election will almost certainly happen in the spring, leaving the Liberal proposals waiting to follow that result.",

    "title": "Why Costa Rica is Considered a “Bimonetary” Economy and Its Myths",
    "text": "Many kinds of transactions are done with the US currency Costa Rica is a small and open economy. Consumers buy most goods and services in colones. However, despite the country not being dollarized, there are some goods and services that are mostly offered in dollars. For example: vehicles, properties (sales and rentals), and certain services such as tourism. Even, there are companies that pay their salaries in dollars. Banks offer loans in dollars, not forgetting that the government and public institutions also conduct transactions in dollars. So, it could be said that Costa Rica is a bimonetary economy , with the dollar being the second most important currency. That’s why there are some myths about the dollar. Some of them are: Myth 1: Prices in dollars are lower. Sometimes people see a price difference because the dollar amounts have few digits. This is corrected by converting the figure to colones. Myth 2: Online purchases with prices in dollars do not pay the VAT tax. The reality is that all products and services consumed in the country (whether purchased in dollars or colones, online or not) are subject to tax payment, except for those exempted like the basic food items. Myth 3: If the dollar goes down, you have to go into debt in dollars. In the best-case scenario, if you earn in dollars, you can take advantage of the facilities with loans in that currency; but if you earn in colones, since the exchange rate is variable, you will face the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Myth 4: Is it better to earn in dollars or is it better in colones? It will always depend on which currency the person uses to carry out their transactions (and in what percentage). This way, you can avoid (or not) exchange rate risks. Myth 5: If the dollar rises, you should invest in dollars. The value of the exchange rate varies in the short and long term, therefore, it is not advisable to focus on its daily movements to make an investment decision. In this case, other aspects such as the interest rate relationship and what will happen with the exchange rate must be considered.

    "title": "Bonds Are Back as a Hedge After Failing Investors for Years",
    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Gregg Abella, a money manager in New Jersey, wasn’t expecting the flood of phone calls he got from clients this past week. “Suddenly people are saying to us, ‘Wow, do you think it’s a good time for us to add bonds?” Most Read from Bloomberg It’s something of a vindication for Abella. He’s been, in his words, “banging the gong” for bonds — and asset diversification, more broadly — for years. This was long a decidedly out-of-favor recommendation. Until, that is, stocks started to tumble this month. Quickly, demand for the safety of debt soared, driving 10-year Treasury yields at one point early last week to the lowest levels since mid-2023. The rally has surprised many on Wall Street. The age-old relationship between equities and bonds — wherein fixed-income offsets losses when stocks slump — had been thrown in doubt in recent years. Especially in 2022, when that correlation totally collapsed as bonds failed to provide any protection at all amid the slide in stocks. (US government debt, in fact, posted its worst losses on record that year). But whereas the selloff back then was triggered by an inflation outbreak and the Federal Reserve’s scramble to quell it by ratcheting up interest rates, this latest equities slump has been sparked in large part by fear the economy is slipping into a recession. Expectations for rate cuts, as a result, have mounted fast, and bonds do very well in that environment. “Finally the reason for bonds is shining through,” said Abella, whose firm — Investment Partners Asset Management — oversees about $250 million including for wealthy Americans and non-profits. As the S&P 500 Index lost about 6% across the first three trading days of August, the Treasury market posted gains of almost 2%. That enabled investors with 60% of their assets in stocks and 40% in bonds — a once time-honored strategy for building a diversified portfolio with less volatility — to outperform one that merely held equities. Bonds would eventually erase much of their gains as stocks stabilized over the past few days, but the broader point — that fixed income worked as a hedge at a moment of market chaos — remains. “We’ve been buying government debt,” said George Curtis, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management. Curtis actually first began adding Treasury bonds months ago — both because of the higher yields they now offer and because he too has expected the old stock-bond relationship to return as inflation receded. “It’s there as a hedge,” he said. Inverse Again There’s another way to see that the traditional, inverse relationship between the two asset classes — which mostly held for the first couple decades of this century — is back, at least for now. The one-month correlation between stocks and bonds last week reached the most negative since the aftermath of last year’s regional-bank crisis. A reading of 1 indicates the assets move in lockstep, while minus 1 suggests they move in the opposite direction. A year ago, it eclipsed 0.8, the highest since 1996, indicating bonds were practically useless as portfolio ballast. The relationship was turned on its head as the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes beginning in March 2022 caused both markets to crater. The so-called 60/40 portfolio lost 17% that year, its worst performance since the global financial crisis in 2008. Now the backdrop has shifted back in favor of bonds, with inflation more in check and the focus turning to a potential US recession at a time when yields are still well above their five-year average. The coming week brings plenty of risk for bond bulls. July reports are due out on US producer and consumer prices and any sign of a resurgence in inflation could push yields back up. They already began ticking higher on Thursday after weekly jobless claims — a data point that’s suddenly gaining attention as recession concerns swirl — surprisingly fell, tempering signals that the labor market is weakening. For all the excitement about bonds today, there are still lots of people like Bill Eigen who are leery of jumping back into the market. Eigen, who manages the $10 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, has held more than half of it in cash — mostly in money-market funds that invest in cash-equivalent assets such as Treasury bills —— for the past few years. At just over 5%, short-term T-bills yield at least a full percentage point more than long-term bonds, and Eigen’s not convinced that inflation is truly tame enough nor the economy weak enough to merit the kind of Fed easing that would change that dynamic. “The rate cuts are going to be small and incremental,” he said. “The biggest problem for bonds as a hedge is that we still have an inflationary environment.” What Bloomberg Intelligence Says.. “The yield curve tends to bull steepen going into a recession. The exceptionally brief uninversion of the 2-year/10-year Treasury curve on Aug. 5 could presage a bull-steepening trend that we expect to persist as the economy slows. Meanwhile, we think the equity/bond correlation may be normalizing.” —— Ira F. Jersey and Will Hoffman, BI strategists Click here to read the full report Perhaps. But a growing number of investors have, like Curtis, relegated inflation to a secondary concern. During the height of last week’s market volatility, bond investors sent a fleeting message that their worries about growth were becoming dire. Yields on two-year notes briefly traded below those on 10-year bonds for the first time in two years, an indication the market was bracing for recession and rapid rate reductions. “With inflation trending lower and with risks much more balanced or even tilted towards concerns about more significant economic slowing, we do think bonds are going to exhibit more of their defensive characteristics,” said Daniel Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co.

    "title": "Is Broadcom Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity Ahead of Its 10-for-1 Stock Split on July 12?",
    "text": "When Broadcom ( AVGO 1.19% ) released the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended May 5, the company delivered results that sailed past Wall Street's expectations. More intriguing for shareholders, however, was another development. In conjunction with its financial report, Broadcom's management revealed a 10-for-1 stock split . Since its announcement on Jun 12, shares have climbed 6% (as of this writing), and the stock has gained 93% over the past year. This helps to illustrate the ongoing interest from investors, likely spurred higher by the vast opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI) . The stock split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, July 12. Does the upcoming stock split make Broadcom a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Let's see what the evidence reveals. Stock split recap A quick review of the purpose of the stock split can help give this process context. If a company delivers strong operational and financial performance over an extended period, demand for stock ownership increases, which is reflected in an increasing share price. Unfortunately, this oft times makes the stock inaccessible to some everyday investors. To rectify the situation, management can initiate a stock split, reducing the share price. The company noted in its report that the purpose of the split was \"to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and employees.\" The result is that everyday investors will be better able to buy full shares rather than resorting to purchasing fractional shares , which are available at a number of brokerage firms. Once the stock split is completed, shareholders of record will receive nine additional shares of Broadcom stock for every share they own. At the same time, the price of each share will be reduced to 1/10th of the price, so the total value of each shareholder's investment won't change.The stock is due to split after the market close on Friday July 12, and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, July 15. What should be more important to investors, however, is that the same factors that have driven Broadcom stock higher in recent years will still be at work. Is Broadcom stock a buy? The process of the stock split aside, the quintessential investing question remains: Is Broadcom stock a buy before its highly publicized stock split? Let's take a look at the company's recent results. In the second quarter, Broadcom reported revenue of $12.5 billion, jumping 43% year over year and 4% sequentially. This pushed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96 up 6%. Management said robust demand for generative AI was driving the results, noting that sales of AI-related products surged to a record $3.1 billion and now accounted for 25% of the company's total revenue. Management suggested the trend will likely continue. Broadcom raised its full fiscal year guidance to $51 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 42%. The company is also developing a consistent track record of dividend payments. Broadcom is now in its 14th consecutive year of increasing payouts. From humble beginnings in mid-2013, the company has increased its payout from $0.21 to $5.25 per quarter, an increase of 2,400%. Wall Street expects Broadcom to earn $47.49 per share in 2024. That works out to a payout ratio of 44% of this year's expected profits, based on the current quarterly dividend, so there's plenty of room to increase the payout. A once-in-a-generation investment opportunity? Most experts agree that the accelerating adoption of AI has only just begun, and demand will only grow from here. Because generative AI automates many time-consuming and mundane tasks, it increases productivity, which leads to higher profits. While estimates vary considerably, the impact of generative AI on the economy is expected to be between $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion over the coming decade, according to research compiled by McKinsey & Company, representing a once-in-a-generation opportunity. It's worth noting, however, that estimates have been increasing over time, so the actual impact may be higher as new applications for AI are created. Broadcom's extensive reach in technology circles gives the company the potential to grab an increasingly larger piece of the AI pie. Over the past five years, Broadcom has been on fire, as revenue increased 126%, driving net income up 197%. This, in turn, has driven the stock price up 463% during the same period (as of this writing), more than five times the returns of the S&P 500 . Furthermore, the stock has gained 93% over the past year alone, as its pivotal place in the AI ecosystem is boosting its results. Broadcom currently trades for 33 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its significant outperformance over the past five years, its clear that Broadcom is deserving of a premium. Given the company's strong track record of results, pervasive reach, and prevailing secular tailwinds, I would argue that the evidence supports the case that Broadcom is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split. That said, I don't think it matters if you buy Broadcom before or after the stock split -- as long as you buy it.",

    "title": "Riskiest Real Estate Bonds Are Beating Nvidia’s Returns",
    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- A previously gloomy corner of the debt world has become the biggest winning trade in global financial markets, producing returns that few traders have seen in more than a decade. Most Read from Bloomberg Hybrids, the riskiest slice of a real estate company’s debt, have returned more than 75% this year. For the top 10 performers for the securities also known as subordinated bonds, returns amount to about 170% in the period, beating Nvidia Corp.’s stock, the darling of the AI craze, by 20 percentage points. It’s the kind of swift turnaround that few could have predicted when landlords around the world were creaking under the weight of higher interest rates and changing work habits following the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, real estate debt is becoming an early winner from major central banks cutting borrowing costs amid a pivot to prioritizing the economy over battling inflation. “I cannot recall something similar in my career,” said Andrea Seminara, chief executive officer at London-based Redhedge Asset Management, who started working in finance at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. “The magnitude of the gains is unprecedented, unless we look at pure distressed situations.” Replacement Cost Landlords’ subordinated bonds had plunged nearly 50% after central banks began to increase rates in 2022. Higher borrowing costs meant the cost to replace them shot up, leaving investors fearful that repayment would be delayed indefinitely. Companies can also sometimes skip coupons on the notes without triggering a default, making them less popular with investors. “These bonds were punished due to technical factors,” said Andreas Meyer, founder of Hamburg-based Fountain Square Asset Management. “There was blood on the streets.” For Seminara, buying at those depressed levels was effectively a bet that companies would be able to replace debt that was coming due and that falling inflation would allow central banks to cut interest rates. Both proved correct. The companies faced a so-called maturity wall that collapsed in historic fashion this year as capital flowed into the credit market, allowing landlords to issue new debt to refinance old bonds. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve this month joined the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in cutting its policy rate and leaving open the possibility of further large cuts. Meyer’s event-driven fund is among those that reaped the benefits, gaining as much as 80% in its hybrid bonds. He still has exposure in the sector. The main risk now is that there is little juice left in the trade. Strategists Barnaby Martin and Ioannis Angelakis at Bank of America Corp. flagged in a report last week that “valuations are clearly nearer to becoming full” in real estate credit. Still, buyers and sellers are becoming more confident that the commercial real estate market is bottoming out. Many want to start putting capital to work as the interest rate pain starts to ease. “We have lived through a sh*tstorm. No one has lived through a monetary policy as aggressive as we have seen in the last two years,” Madison International Realty founder Ron Dickerman said in an interview. “A couple of rate cuts does not make a market, but there’s optimism.” Week in Review China disclosed a series of stimulus measures designed to boost flagging growth in the nation. It unveiled its biggest package yet to shore up its beleaguered property market, lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing down-payment requirements for second home purchases to a historical low. China is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy. While some details are missing, the unusual pace and intensity of the stimulus announcements signaled a sense of urgency in Beijing to put growth on track for the around 5% target, buoying market sentiment. Separately, the nation began marketing its first euro-denominated bond in three years. US companies and Asian issuers stormed debt markets following the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to lower its benchmark interest rate by half-a-percentage-point. A resurgence in mergers and acquisitions dealmaking is turbocharging the US high-grade bond market to its fastest pace of issuance since 2020, putting it on track to post $1.5 trillion of sales. Banks and other lenders are lining up more than €10 billion ($11.1 billion) of debt to back a buyout of Sanofi SA’s consumer health division, as one of the most hotly-anticipated sales of the year reaches its final stages. Blue Owl Capital Inc. led the $3.2 billion private debt financing supporting Blackstone Inc. and Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software firm Smartsheet Inc., with 20 other lenders participating. Citigroup Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are teaming up in the fast-growing private credit market, agreeing to work together on $25 billion worth of deals over the next five years. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s structured credit business Atlas SP Partners received its broker-dealer license and is preparing to start secondary trading. Country Garden Holdings Co. has won bondholders’ approval to push back payments on its nine yuan bonds by six months, giving the developer more time to map out an onshore debt overhaul. Credit Agricole SA is looking to raise capital with a bond that has to be repaid after only a decade, adding to a recent raft of longer-duration instruments as investors look to take advantage of the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts. Altice France has held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, a move that would potentially hurt existing creditors. A group of banks led by Bank of America Corp. sweetened terms on a leveraged loan offering to help finance Platinum Equity’s acquisition of GSM Outdoors as the deal struggled to attract demand from investors. Dish Network Corp. is close to striking a deal with some of its convertible bondholders that would give the company new financing and help it extend its debt maturities. Hooters of America is huddling with lenders and advisers amid revenue declines that pushed the restaurant chain to shutter several of its locations. On the Move Brian Sauvigne, a former Blackstone Inc. senior managing director, rejoined Bank of Montreal’s financial-sponsors group. RBC Capital Markets hired Sam Pfeiffer, previously with Morgan Stanley, as head of US investment grade systematic credit trading. M&G Investments recruited Joe Sullivan-Bissett to be an investment director in its £137 billion fixed income division, reporting to David Parsons, head of the fixed income specialist team. Alberta Investment Management Corp. appointed David Scudellari, the fund’s head of international investment, to oversee private assets and strategic partnerships, and Justin Lord as senior executive managing director for public markets. Meanwhile, Chief Investment Officer Marlene Puffer is departing. --With assistance from Eleanor Duncan and Dan Wilchins. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "title": "Africa: Financing Africa's Future",
    "text": "Bold international cooperation is essential to break Africa's debt cycle and unlock sustainable development. Africa's debt is rising roughly four times faster than its economic growth, jumping 10 percentage points from 2010 to constitute 29% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2022. This alarming trajectory demands a rethink of how international partnerships could better support the continent's progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. As the global balance of power shifts, Africa's demographic dividend and resource wealth position it as pivotal in shaping a fair and inclusive multipolar world. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says a debt threshold range of 70%-90% of GDP is appropriate for high-income countries such as the United States (US) and Japan, and 30%-50% for emerging economies, including Africa's 46 low- and lower-middle-income economies. It says a prudent debt target should average 15 percentage points below the debt threshold since exogenous events, like COVID-19 or Russia's invasion of Ukraine, could push up interest rates. So most African countries can only sustain debt levels of 15%-35% of GDP, it says. Many African countries have consistently exceeded these levels due to high borrowing costs, currency volatility and slow growth. United Nations Trade and Development says African countries face financing costs averaging 8.5 percentage points higher than the US rate. Some nations, like Tunisia and Nigeria, are effectively shut out of financial markets due to prohibitive costs. Africa's infrastructure financing gap is immense, with growing demands for schools, hospitals and transport systems driven by population growth. Domestic revenue mobilisation remains low , leaving many countries reliant on external borrowing. Although tax revenue mobilisation performance varies widely across African countries, Africa's average tax-to-GDP ratio of 16.5% is lower than other regions, such as Asia and the Pacific (19.1%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (21.9%). It is 33.5% in OECD countries. Government expenditure is often also unproductive, reflected in the low measure of government effectiveness as measured by the World Bank , and high corruption levels shown in Transparency International data and others. Trapped on the horns of a dilemma that needs significant government expenditure to fund its development, and unable to fund that domestically, Africa increasingly turns to private creditors and China instead of concessional financing from international financial institutions (IFIs). The latter often involve cumbersome conditions. This conundrum requires several responses, starting with improving the quality of domestic governance and extending all the way to restructuring voting rights within the IFIs. Africans must be able to afford much higher debt levels (at least 50%-60% of GDP), which must be available at low, concessional rates - meaning someone, somewhere, needs to offset the additional risk premium. Who will grasp this nettle? How can we engineer a common approach to Africa's development dilemma that includes China, the West, private bondholders and development banks? To some degree financial engineering could be used 'to contain a surge in borrowing costs without taking on more debt from official lenders,' notes the Financial Times . For example, recently the World Bank announced it would underwrite a loan to Côte d'Ivoire to replace costly bonds. Through this 'debt for development' swap, the country will use cheap financing to back close to €400 million in bonds that will be up for repayment in the next few years and put the savings into public spending. Africa's development pathway requires bold international cooperation that acknowledges the continent's unique challenges and opportunities in a multipolar world. An international partnership framework must be built on principles of mutual accountability, transparency, sustainability, and equitable risk-sharing between all creditors and debtors. Three key strategies could add to a visionary global framework. The first is to restructure IFIs . Africa's voice must be amplified in decision-making processes at the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other multilateral lenders. Voting rights should be revised to reflect Africa's growing significance and ensure that risk assessments by agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch are objective, rational and unbiased. A dedicated African sovereign rating agency could address some of these concerns. Western companies and countries would probably continue relying on information from agencies they know and trust - but perhaps using a spread of agencies could be negotiated. IFIs must also scale up concessional financing for Africa, offering loans at lower rates to enable sustainable borrowing. A second strategy would involve establishing a global compact on Africa's development, endorsed by leading economies and regional organisations like the African Union, to mobilise funding for critical infrastructure projects. This compact should involve a mix of grants, concessional loans and private-sector investment guarantees, with clear accountability mechanisms. Development aid could help subsidise the risk premiums associated with lending to African economies and investments in projects in Africa. Partnerships must also tap into Africa's diaspora through innovative tools like diaspora bonds to fund critical development projects. Annual remittance flows to Africa have already exceeded aid by more than US$50 billion. Third, economic diversification and value addition should be promoted. International partnerships should prioritise support for Africa's transition from commodity exports to value-added industries. This includes investments in technology transfer, capacity building and market access initiatives to ensure that Africa captures greater value from global trade. Single-commodity-based economies are vulnerable to price swings. Yet, today, Africa is more commodity-dependent than ever , and the quality of governance is declining. Regional agreements like the African Continental Free Trade Area should be fully implemented to strengthen intra-African trade.

Beyond financing, Africa's success hinges on fiscal discipline, political stability and enhanced domestic governance. However, immediate relief lies in creating equitable international partnerships that address the continent's specific needs. Using the International Futures forecasting platform , our forecasts show that Africa's average economic growth rate for the next 10 years is a measly 4.2%. Since the continent's population is expected to grow at 2.4%, this translates into GDP per capita growth at less than 1% a year. This implies that by 2030, 454 million Africans (26% of Africa's population) will still live in extreme poverty. Africa's prosperity benefits everyone, and the current prospects of a growing divide between Africa's and income averages elsewhere will eventually threaten global stability and prosperity. It will accelerate climate change, given the inevitable increases in the continent's carbon emissions that will accompany economic growth. A prosperous and stable Africa would contribute to global security, reduce irregular migration and expand trade opportunities, benefitting the entire world.

    "title": "Aussie graduate's major $83,000 HECS warning: 'Out of hand'",
    "text": "An Aussie worker wishes she had properly thought through her before undertaking them. People all across the country are struggling with paying off their and some fear they will to zero. about how the growing debt has put them off starting a family, getting a house or other . Jessica's HECS loan has ballooned out to $83,000 and she said a \"different path\" might have been better for her. \"I don't regret going to uni, but I do regret not thinking it through with the cost,\" she told . RELATED \"I think if I'd chosen something that wasn't as heavily saturated, like event management, something more like nursing or teaching, I think that it would have led me down a different path, and there'd be less HECS debt.\" She did a Bachelor of Business, majoring in event management and a second major in marketing, before embarking on two Masters degrees. However, Jessica said it was almost impossible to work, live, and study as there wasn't enough financial support from the government. So, she dropped out after her first semester of her Masters. The graduate explained that when she first entered the event management sector, she wasn't earning above the threshold (which currently sits at $54,435) and therefore wasn't paying off her HECS. \"So over that period of time, interest was occurring on my debt, and it kind of got a little bit out of out of hand, so to speak,\" she said. In a further blow, her industry was decimated during the COVID pandemic because events were effectively put on ice until people could be in the same room together again. So, she doubled down and pursued \"more education\". That saw her HECS loan go even higher. The Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) was introduced in 1989 and is one of the programs under the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) that provides financial support for students. If you earn under $54,435, then you will not contribute to that loan. However, the moment you go above that threshold, a portion of your salary will go towards paying off your HECS. That portion is determined by your income. You can also make voluntary contributions if you have spare cash and want to get to zero faster. However, the HECS loan is indexed every year to keep up with inflation, which is why the debt is seemingly never paid off for many Aussies. Chloe Rae said the indexation she was charged this year was more than triple what she repaid through her compulsory repayments. The 23-year-old, who works in publishing, told her has already jumped from about $18,000 to $23,500 in the last two years despite her compulsory repayments. This year's indexation kicked in on June 1 and was 4.7 per cent, which was the second highest in years. Rae, like Jessica, said the cost of tertiary education should have been a bigger factor when deciding to go to university. “I think we’re sold a lie about how harmless HECS is ... They always say it’s the best debt you’ll ever have but at the end of the day, it’s still a debt, you still owe money and it still grows,” she told Aussies appeared to be divided on Jessica's complaints on the HECS system, with some agreeing that it's unfair to slug young people with so much debt, while others said that's the way the cookie crumbles. \"Indexation on HECS is disgusting, as is the constant lowering of the income at which you must pay it back. It's practically fraudulent the way HECS are sold to 18yo's as an interest-free loan, only to be surprised and confronted by a yearly indexation,\" wrote one person. \"When we were in high school, we were told to think of HECS as an interest-free loan. We were told to go to university or we wouldn’t be employable. We were convinced that the only way towards being successful was to go to university,\" said another. But one student hit back, saying: \"The HECS system is excellent. People need to take more personal responsibility for their choices. I’m currently halfway through my bachelor of science, the Commonwealth pays half, I pay the other half. That’s more than fair.\" A fourth commented: \"I graduated in engineering 2.5 years ago, but was already paying back my HECS during uni, there is no free lunch. Work, pay back your debt, but it will require sacrifice (I also have no family in Australia, no financial help from my family. I paid rent by myself while studying and working, and now I even own my place.\" The government announced earlier this year it was introducing legislation to change the way student loans were indexed. At the moment, the indexation is tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), however, the new rules would see your debt impacted by whatever is lower out of CPI or the Wage Price Index. That would have seen this year's indexation be 4 per cent and the 2022-23 year be just 3.2 per cent instead of 7.1 per cent. The move is expected to be backdated and could wipe a collective $3 billion from everyone's debt. The change is yet to pass through parliament.",

    "title": "Anadolu will continue to inform world about Israeli ‘genocide, war crimes’: CEO Karagoz",
    "text": "SAKARYA, Türkiye Serdar Karagoz, president and CEO of Anadolu, said on Friday that Anadolu will continue to inform the world about Israel's \"genocide and war crimes\" in the most effective way through its books The Witness, The Evidence, and The Perpetrator. Karagoz was speaking at the Middle East Congress on Politics and Society organized this year with the main theme of \"Israel-Palestine Conflict.\" The congress was organized at Türkiye's Sakarya University (SAU)'s Culture and Congress Center in cooperation with SAU's Middle East Institute, Spain's Granada University's Institution of Peace and Conflicts, and Euro-Arab Foundation for Higher Studies (FUNDEA). In his speech, Karagoz stated that the words \"genocide, Gaza and Israel\" have been appearing side by side since October last year and that the concept of genocide was discussed in different events around the world before. Noting that genocide and war crimes have definitions within the framework of international law, but that these definitions are applied to some countries and never applied to others, he said: “Despite everything, we continue to keep records of genocides and war crimes as the world goes on.\" \"These records may not turn into any sanctions before the International Criminal Court today, but one day they will. It may be when the perpetrators of these crimes are gone from this world, or it may be years and years later, but one day the perpetrators of these crimes will be held accountable by law, justice and history,” he added. Stressing that those working in the field of media have to keep these records, Karagoz referred to journalist Seymour Hersh who played an important role in revealing the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. 'When you drop a phosphorus bomb on a city, you commit a war crime' Explaining that Anadolu has been closely following Israel's war crimes in Gaza since October 2023, Karagoz, referring to the phosphorus bombs used by Israel, said: “You have the right to drop a phosphorus bomb on an empty land, provided that you illuminate the land and observe the enemy elements. However, when you drop a phosphorus bomb on a city, as seen here, you are undoubtedly committing a war crime beyond any doubt.” He stated that Anadolu captured the moment when the phosphorus bombs were loaded on howitzers and that photographs displaying the code of the phosphorus bombs were taken. \"When we present this photograph to the International Criminal Court, even this photograph alone ensures that a country is punished, punished for war crimes,\" added Karagoz. 'We leave a mark by documenting these genocides' Stressing that Anadolu's book The Evidence compiles the war crimes committed by Israel by focusing on international law and the Rome Statute, and is one of the most fundamental pieces of evidence in the genocide trial in The Hague, Karagoz said: \"We are also leaving a mark by fighting against this and documenting these genocides.\" Stating that the book Evidence turned into a documentary, he noted: \"This documentary shows a reality that is too big to object to.\" Karagoz said that in addition to The Evidence, the book Witness was also turned into a documentary, adding that they would show this documentary in many places around the world. Regarding Anadolu's other book The Perpetrator, Karagoz said: “It will include all those who were involved in these crimes, who were the perpetrators themselves or who had a share in these crimes by supporting them. Israel did not only hit Gaza. It also broke the established international legal order, and the world order.\" He stated that Anadolu has been collecting these documents not for today's broken and bankrupt international legal order, but for the just international legal order to be established one day. Highlighting Anadolu's war journalism training, Karagoz added: “Many of our friends have seen wars, but no one has ever seen such a big, brutal, inhuman war.” Israel has continued a devastating offensive on Gaza since October last year despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire. More than 42,800 people have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 100,500 others injured, according to local health authorities. Israel faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza. *Writing by Serdar Dincel",

    "title": "Archegos’ Bill Hwang Sentenced to 18 Years in Prison for Massive US Fraud",
    "text": "NEW YORK—Former billionaire investor Sung Kook “Bill” Hwang was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Wednesday over the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, which cost Wall Street banks more than $10 billion. Hwang was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan, where a jury convicted Hwang in July on 10 criminal charges including wire fraud, securities fraud and market manipulation. Archegos’ March 2021 implosion took less than a week, stunning Wall Street and Hwang’s lenders. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan sought a 21-year prison term for Hwang - unusually long for a white-collar case - and for him to forfeit $12.35 billion and make restitution to victims. “It stands among a rare class of cases that truly could be described as a national calamity,” prosecutor Andrew Thomas said at the sentencing hearing before Hellerstein. Before sentencing Hwang, Hellerstein asked the defendant’s lawyer, Dani James, how she thought Hwang compared to Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from users of the now-bankrupt FTX exchange. “Mr. Bankman-Fried was literally stealing from his customers,” James said. “I don’t think that’s what’s happened here.” Hwang had asked for no prison, forfeiture or restitution, and to remain free on bail while he appealed his conviction. James said his low risk of committing more crimes meant a lengthy prison term served no purpose. “The notion that he would commit a crime in the future, it’s just not so,” James said. He set up Archegos in New York as a family office in 2013, the year after his former hedge fund Tiger Asia Management pleaded guilty to wire fraud in an insider-trading case. Prosecutors accused Hwang of lying to banks about Archegos’ portfolio so he could borrow money aggressively and make concentrated bets on media and technology stocks such as ViacomCBS, now called Paramount Global. While Archegos eventually managed $36 billion, Hwang’s borrowing helped him amass $160 billion of exposure to stocks. His downfall occurred when Hwang was unable to meet margin calls, as the prices of some of his favorite stocks began falling and various banks unloaded stocks that had backed his so-called total return swaps. More than $100 billion of market value in Hwang’s stocks was wiped out. Several banks suffered losses, including Credit Suisse, which lost $5.5 billion, and Nomura Holdings. Credit Suisse is now part of UBS. Hwang’s lawyers’ request for no punishment also cited Hwang’s Christian faith and his nonprofit Grace and Mercy Foundation, which has since 2006 donated at least $600 million to combat homelessness, poverty and human trafficking, among other causes. Hwang’s lawyers have said his net worth has fallen to “at most” $55.3 million. Hwang’s co-defendant, former Archegos Chief Financial Officer Patrick Halligan, was convicted at the same trial on three criminal charges. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 27. Both chose not to testify at their two-month trial.",

    "title": "Young Chinese seek alternative jobs in shifting economy",
    "text": "Aspiring actress Guo Ting gets ready for an audition in Hengdian, Zhejiang, China. Guo is part of a trend of young Chinese giving up the traditional aspiration of a stable, mainstream job in exchange for alternative careers and a chance at self-fulfillment. HENGDIAN, China - Braving loneliness and tough auditions, aspiring actress Guo Ting is determined to make it in China’s answer to Hollywood. The 27-year-old from northern China quit her white-collar job in Beijing this year to move to Hengdian, home to major movie studios and casting agencies. Guo is part of a trend of young Chinese giving up the traditional aspiration of a stable, mainstream job in exchange for alternative careers and a chance at self-fulfillment. She has dreamed of becoming an actor since childhood, an ambition initially squashed by pragmatic adults around her. But after a few years working in an office, Guo now believes “happiness is most important”. Chinese media and online posts in recent years have drawn public attention to young people trading in their careers for a diverse range of other options, including a nomadic “van life”, becoming an influencer, or pursuing art. While they remain a small minority, the growing discussion around their choices reflects broader changes in the world’s second-largest economy after decades of breakneck growth. Some people, especially those from more prosperous backgrounds, now “try to redefine what is successful”, said Miao Jia, a sociology expert from New York University Shanghai. “When they receive better education and after they have enjoyed the benefits brought by rapid economic growth, (young people) begin to think about what things can make you happy,” she told AFP. Shifting norms Guo’s decision to restart her career comes at a time of major shifts in how young Chinese people perceive work. In recent years, more defeatist concepts like “lying flat” and “letting it rot” have gained popularity among those grappling with intense job competition. At the same time, other jobseekers anxious about an ongoing economic slowdown and a volatile private sector have flocked to the “iron rice bowls” of civil service and state-owned enterprise jobs. Many others have trouble finding work altogether, with youth unemployment reaching 14.2 per cent in May. “The younger generation in China is becoming more and more diverse than the previous generation,” said Miao of NYU Shanghai. And while going to an office may be the norm for urban middle-class youth, for large parts of the country, desk jobs are a rare opportunity.

PHOTO: AFP For Ouyang, a 20-year-old middle school graduate living in global trading hub Yiwu, the small fluorescent-lit office where he helps run an e-commerce business is a novelty. In his hometown in central China’s Henan province, Ouyang, who asked to be identified by a nickname over privacy concerns, “did everything”. “I was a restaurant server. It was very chaotic, and it felt like I was just killing time with work,” he said. Put off by the lower pay in his hometown, Ouyang recently jumped at the chance to become a livestream seller of cheap goods after meeting online friends in the business. ‘Routine was meaningless’ Back in Hengdian, Guo prepared for an audition with a meticulous multi-step skincare routine in the apartment she shares with other film industry hopefuls. Getting ready to play a corporate character working at a fictional firm, she rummaged through her wardrobe for an outfit similar to those she wore for her office job. The casting agent’s office was next door to a community space run by an actors’ union, where dozens of people sat waiting for auditions and job interviews. Currently, Guo only makes around 2,000 yuan (S$370) a month from the handful of jobs she can secure. “In the past, I had a stable monthly salary, and I never had to worry that I wouldn’t have enough to spend,” she said. The change from the more social environment of her former workplace to a solitary freelance life was also hard to adjust to initially. But Guo said she and her peers were motivated by more than just money. The other Hengdian transplants she knows who left mainstream jobs “felt that following a prescribed routine was meaningless.” AFP Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

    "title": "Matthews International Responds to Barington Capital and Affirms Board and Management’s Focus on Driving Long-Term Value Creation",
    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matthews International Corporation (NASDAQ GSM: MATW) (“Matthews” or the “Company”) today issued the following statement in response to the recent statement and nomination notice the Company has received from Barington Capital Group (“Barington”): Our recent operating results reflect solid performance by our core businesses and demonstrate the resilience of our team in the face of a challenging market environment. As a result of strong execution and oversight by the Matthews Board of Directors and management team, the fundamentals of our businesses and their long-term outlook are strong: • Memorialization has benefited from pricing actions and several smaller strategic acquisitions, while delivering on cremation and mausoleum-related products that underscore the segment’s long-term commitment to diversify its best-in-class offerings within the deathcare industry. Cost control measures taken during the fiscal year have also contributed to an improvement in operating margins. • SGK recently reported its third consecutive quarter of higher sequential sales and solid margins. Notably, the strategic decision to invest in resources to support the transitioning of components of our core business to an e-commerce digital marketing platform differentiates us from our peers and led to an increase in revenues and organic business opportunities that position us well for 2025. • Within Industrial Technologies we expect the demand recovery to have a positive impact at the start of our new fiscal year, which should result in meaningful revenue results in the latter part of fiscal 2025 and into 2026. • Interest in the innovative solutions being offered through our Energy Solutions business remains strong, and we are well positioned both financially and operationally to lead the ongoing transition to electric vehicles through our multi-decade investment in advanced rotary processing technologies and alternative solutions for such technologies. As previously announced on our fourth quarter earnings call, Matthews has retained J.P. Morgan to support the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives. The Board is dedicated to driving long-term value creation, and the strategic alternatives process is a reflection of that commitment. Importantly, in late November, Matthews also declared its 31 st consecutive annual dividend increase since becoming a public company. As Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Bartolacci has led the Company’s growth from approximately $700 million in revenues in fiscal 2006, to approximately $1.8 billion today. Mr. Bartolacci’s strategic vision, including various strategic acquisitions over several years aimed at expanding the Company’s casket manufacturing and distribution capabilities, has fostered an organization that is a strong, diversified and resilient provider of innovative solutions for customers around the globe. Under Mr. Bartolacci’s leadership, Matthews remains dedicated to driving improved performance and sustainable growth for all of the Company’s stakeholders. Matthews’ refreshed, diverse and fit-for-purpose Board actively oversees the Company’s strategy. Members of the Board bring many years of expertise at public companies, including across industrial and manufacturing industries, as well as corporate governance, finance, marketing, sales, strategy and human resources. The Board will continue its regular refreshment and believes a variety of perspectives facilitates effective decision-making, helps drive long-term value, and encourages different views on risk, business strategy and innovation. Notably, the Board has added two new independent directors over the past two years and three independent directors over the past five years. Engagement with Barington Capital The Board and leadership team have a long-term relationship with Barington and remain open to constructive dialogue. As previously announced on December 30, 2022, Matthews entered into an agreement with Barington, pursuant to which Barington served as a consultant to Matthews. On October 18, 2023, Matthews and Barington agreed to extend the agreement, allowing Jim Mitarotonda to continue to meet with the Company’s business leaders on a quarterly basis. Contrary to his position today, Mitarotonda has previously commended the management team and its performance. In October 2024, Matthews attempted to continue consulting with Mr. Mitarotonda about the Company’s evaluation of its portfolio to unlock value. Mr. Mitarotonda refused. Now that the agreement with Barington has expired, rather than engage in a private dialogue with our Board and potentially exploring a constructive path forward, Barington has decided to wage a costly and disruptive proxy contest. The Matthews Board and management team are committed to serving in the best interests of all our shareholders, and as the evaluation of strategic alternatives underscores, we will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of driving long-term value creation for all our shareholders. Shareholders are not required to take any action at this time. The Board will present its recommendations with respect to the election of directors in the Company's definitive proxy statement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to all shareholders eligible to vote at the 2025 Annual Meeting. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor and Jones Day is serving as legal counsel to Matthews.

    "title": "UDF IV Raises Serious Concerns Regarding the Detrimental Impact of NexPoint’s Campaign in Letter to Shareholders",
    "text": "Highlights NexPoint’s Abysmal Track Record of Managing Its Own Fund and Dubious Business Ethics and Practices Reiterates the UDF IV Board of Trustees’ Track Record of Delivering Shareholder Returns Board of Trustees Urges Shareholders Vote FOR Its Highly Qualified Trustee Nominees on the WHITE Proxy Card IRVING, Texas, Sept. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Development Funding IV (“UDF IV” or the “Trust”) mailed a letter to shareholders raising serious concerns regarding the detrimental impact of NexPoint Real Estate Opportunities, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of NexPoint Diversified Residential Trust (NXDT), and its affiliates’ (collectively, “NexPoint”) campaign to elect a slate of dissident trustee nominees at the Trust’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The letter to shareholders and other important information regarding the Trust’s ongoing commitment to value creation and track record of delivering shareholder returns, including UDF IV’s proxy materials, can be found at UDFforShareholders.com . The Trust urges shareholders to support the Board that is enhancing the value of their investment by voting on the WHITE proxy card “FOR” the Board’s nominees - Steven J. Finkle, Lawrence S. Jones, J. Heath Malone and Phillip K. Marshall. The UDF IV shareholders should discard any green or other color proxy card sent by NexPoint. The full text of the letter to shareholders follows: Dear UDF IV Shareholders, You face a critical decision regarding the future of your investment at United Development Funding IV’s (“UDF IV” or the “Trust”) upcoming Annual Shareholder Meeting (the “Annual Meeting”), which will take place in the fourth quarter of 2024. Your Board of Trustees and management team are relentlessly focused on promoting the interests of the Trust’s shareholders and building on our long track record of delivering value to shareholders. Thanks to the Board’s decisive actions and oversight, UDF IV has paid cash distributions of: ~$38 million, or ~$1.24 per share , since reinstating distributions in the third quarter of 2019 ~$185.7 million, ~$6.06 per share , since the Trust’s inception We are continuing to build on the Trust’s long history of paying cash distributions as the Board recently declared a cash distribution of $0.13 per share for the third quarter of 2024. We urge you to support the Board that is delivering significant returns by voting “FOR” ONLY the Board’s four nominees – Lawrence S. Jones, Phillip K. Marshall, Steven J. Finkle, and J. Heath Malone – on the WHITE proxy card. Despite your Board’s work to enhance the value of your investment, NexPoint Real Estate Opportunities, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of NexPoint Diversified Residential Trust (NXDT), and its affiliates (collectively, “NexPoint”) continue to pursue a self-interested campaign at the expense of all UDF IV shareholders. To date, NexPoint has yet to present any viable plan to enhance shareholder value at UDF IV. This confirms our suspicions that NexPoint’s campaign is simply its latest ploy aimed at extracting the value of the Trust’s portfolio for its own benefit at the expense of shareholders. NexPoint’s actions against the Trust and its leadership’s track record raise serious concerns regarding the detrimental implications for UDF IV shareholders should NexPoint’s campaign succeed. NexPoint has attempted to take over management of the Trust for the past 5+ years, causing significant disruption to the Trust’s operations and undermining our shareholders’ investment. NexPoint has launched numerous frivolous lawsuits against the Trust – including a defamation suit – forcing the Trust to waste resources that could otherwise be used for the benefit of shareholders. In 2020, NexPoint launched a hostile tender offer, which it extended 13 times, to purchase Trust shares at the bargain basement price of $1.10 per share, or approximately a 90% discount to the Trust’s book value per share at the time. Given that NexPoint is seeking to take over management of UDF IV, it is only fair to ask, “How has NexPoint’s own fund performed?” The facts are clear – NexPoint has an abysmal track record of managing its own fund. A subsidiary of NexPoint Advisors is the advisor to NexPoint Diversified Residential Trust (NXDT), the NexPoint fund that owns UDF IV shares. Per NXDT’s Q1 2024 Investor Presentation, as of March 31, 2024, NXDT was trading at a 61.3% discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV). As of August 16, 2024, the trading price of NXDT shares declined by 69.02% during the prior two years, while the S&P 500 benchmark index increased 29.01% during the same time period. Shareholders should have serious concerns relating to NexPoint’s business ethics and practices. Affiliates of James Dondero, NexPoint’s founder, have engaged in willful misconduct and breached their fiduciary duty, and James Dondero and his affiliates are alleged to have engaged in fraudulent transfer of assets and self-dealing. UBS Securities (“UBS”) filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court against James Dondero and several of his current or previous affiliates, claiming he schemed to prevent UBS from collecting $1.3 billion in judgments UBS obtained against entities managed indirectly by Highland Capital Management, L.P. See UBS Securities LLC v. Dondero, New York State Supreme Court, New York County. The SEC issued an Order finding that Highland Capital Management LP, a now bankrupt investment firm co-founded by Dondero, willfully violated Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act. See Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3939, Sept, 25, 2014. A JAMS arbitration panel found that ACIS Capital Management GP, LLC breached its fiduciary duty while James Dondero was an officer. See Terry v. Highland Capital et al, JAMS Arbitration No. 1310022713. The future of your investment is at stake. We ask that you vote “FOR” ONLY the Board’s four nominees on the WHITE proxy card today to enable the UDF IV Board to continue to advance your interests and prevent NexPoint from successfully implementing what we expect will be a self-serving, value-destructive agenda. Thank you again for your continued support. Sincerely, The UDF IV Board of Trustees If you have any questions or require any assistance with respect to voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor: INNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED Shareholders may call: 1 (877) 750-9496 (toll-free from the U.S. and Canada) +1 (412) 232-3651 (from other countries) About United Development Funding IV United Development Funding IV is a Maryland real estate investment trust.

Debt-free: Following the completion of the rights issue, the convertible bonds, amounting to SEK 108.3 M (including accrued interest) was repaid. Operating profit is impacted by two non-cash items: a SEK 34.3 write-down of capitalized R&D projects and a SEK 183.6 M goodwill write-down related to the acquisition of Delta ID that was finalized in 2017.

CEO’s comments Performance and Transformation Overview Our Transformation Plan, initiated in Q4 2023, aims to return Fingerprints to profitability. A critical component of this plan is Portfolio Refresh, where we exit commoditized, low-margin markets to focus on profitable growth segments. Key achievements include the complete exit of the Mobile product group, which has already contributed to gross margin improvement and significantly reduced our operational costs. Headcount reduction (42% since the end of 2023) demonstrates our commitment to cost optimization and improved cash flow. While our Access product group shows sequential growth, the PC market is rapidly commoditizing like Mobile. We will wind down this product group, achieving further cost reductions and entirely exiting China. In parallel, we are advancing strategic discussions with potential investment partners for our product lines – Access, Payment, and PC – to unlock additional growth capital and enhance value creation. Revenue performance: navigating strategic transition Our Q3 results reflect our ongoing transformation. While Mobile revenues continue to decline as we wind down operations, the segment still contributed significant revenue this quarter – albeit at a low margin – marking the final stages of its lifecycle. For our product groups outside Mobile, revenue performance was mixed. In the PC product line, slower sales partly stemmed from some models incorporating our technology that are now reaching later lifecycle stages. Customer shifts to other suppliers as part of risk diversification strategies have also impacted our market share, given our status as a smaller-cap company. Securing new PC projects is capital-intensive and generally takes longer compared to the Mobile industry, reinforcing our dicision to wind this business down while we seek partners to benefit from our assets and support our customers. In contrast, our Access product line demonstrated robust sequential growth this quarter, maintaining the positive momentum from earlier in the year. Market demand for biometric authentication—particularly for FIDO-certified products—remains strong. To capture these opportunities, we introduced FPC AllKey, a versatile, high-security biometric solution for various devices, from smart door locks to cryptocurrency wallets. This launch strengthens our position in the access control market and broadens our addressable market in secure authentication. Cost Optimization and enhanced operational efficiency Cost reduction remains pivotal in our transformation efforts. By the end of September, we had lowered our headcount, including consultants, to 107 from 119 in June 2024, primarily driven by our ongoing transition out of Mobile, our outsourced manufacturing model, and increased operational efficiency. As a result of the PC wind-down, we will continue to implement cost reduction measures in the fourth quarter in order to significantly improve our OPEX run rate by the end of this year. In addition, our objective is to reach an annualized OPEX run-rate of less than SEK 70 million by the end of Q2 2025, underscoring our commitment to operational efficiency and disciplined resource allocation. Strengthened gross margin from strategic refocus Adjusted for R&D depreciation, our gross margin improved to 38.7%, compared to 25.4% in Q2 2024. While continued intense price pressure within our remaining Mobile operations impacted gross margin, the segment benefitted from a marketing incentive adjustment as part of the wind-down. As we entirely phase out Mobile operations, we expect further gross margin improvements by reallocating resources to growth segments aligned with our profitability goals, fully supporting our transformation plan. Debt-free We completed the rights issue in September, with HCM subscribing to the remaining shares under their guarantee commitments. Following this, we fully repaid SEK 108 million in convertible bonds, including accrued interest, leaving Fingerprints debt-free and ensuring a level playing field for all shareholders. Digital Identity: innovation and strategic Positioning Fingerprints continues to expand its digital identity footprint, most recently with the launch of our 4th generation iris recognition software. This \"just glance\" technology offers secure, touchless authentication with exceptional versatility, performing reliably even with accessories like glasses and masks. It supports privacy-sensitive sectors, including automotive and access control, and is well-suited for Zero Trust security frameworks, where it mitigates deepfake risks and enhances system-level security. System integration with select customers will begin in Q1 2025, marking a critical step in broadening our digital identity offerings. Looking ahead, we are committed to building a robust digital identity platform to help our customers address the myriad cyber-risks and poor user experience arising from passwords. As we complete the phase-out of our Mobile segment, we are strategically reallocating capital toward high-margin, high-growth segments in digital identity. Our investment plans include partnerships and technological advancements that strengthen our identity solutions, with a particular focus on sectors requiring advanced authentication, such as enterprise security, both in edge modalities and in the cloud. These partnerships will enable us to deliver scalable, innovative solutions tailored to evolving market needs. Our transformation is designed to ensure sustained profitable growth. Ongoing cost optimization will keep Fingerprints lean and agile, while targeted investments in digital identity reinforce our leadership in secure authentication. As we carve out our digital identity and secure authentication specialty, Fingerprints is well-positioned for sustainable growth and long-term value creation through these initiatives. Adam Philpott, President and CEO Today at 09:00 CET, Fingerprints’ CEO Adam Philpott will present the report together with CFO Fredrik Hedlund in a combined webcast and telephone conference. The presentation will be held in English.

    "title": "Rates Spark: Another 0.2% And The Rate Cut Story Is Intact",
    "text": "RichHobson By Padhraic Garvey, CFA | Michiel Tukker | Benjamin Schroeder Get through the PCE price index intact, and the day should quickly drift into the weekend The US 7yr auction was not so hot on a near 1bp tail, although the indirect bid at 75% was very respectable. The 7yr is a betwixt-and-between maturity, without the weight of the 10yr reference, nor the cross-over popularity of the 5yr. The lower size in part reflects this. And despite the tail, another $49bn is safely away from the US Treasury perspective. There is little doubt that the rate cutting target ahead is masking any possible concern there could be on issuance sizes and fiscal pressure. It's helping lower yielding product to get done, as the prognosis into a number of rate cutting events is for yields to ease lower leaving, auction takedowns today in the money on a 3mth forward basis. Barring a surprise on the PCE price index front, Friday is likely to be a quietish day as players will have one eye on the Labor Day weekend. In fact, many will be taking the Friday off to make it a proper long weekend. The baseline expectation is we continue with the 0.2% month-on-month (or lower) readings. That's all we need to keep the rate cut narrative alive and well, and reasonably aggressive to the downside. If we pop that into our back pockets, the rest of the day should then be a drift. Apart from getting through the spikes being seen in SOFR as we get through another month end of window dressing by the banks, this has caused them to withdraw from repo. Barring the unexpected, that should be broadly back to a more normal footing by next week. Inflation data improving but not there yet for consecutive ECB cuts The German and Spanish inflation numbers were welcomed by markets as both headline figures came in below consensus. The German headline CPI number even hit 2.0% year-on-year, right on the European Central Bank's inflation target. These figures should help with tomorrow's eurozone CPI data, of which the core component is expected to come in at 2.8%, just a notch below the prior reading of 2.9%. The front end of the curve ended the day lower, with the 2Y Bund now well below 2.4%. But overall, the impact was not that material, which makes sense given markets are already pricing 65bp of ECB cuts for 2024. For September, a full 25bp cut is priced in, which seems fair, but market positioning also implies a 50% probability of an October cut immediately thereafter. Various ECB speakers have already warned that a September cut is not necessarily the start of a series of consecutive cuts, and we think current pricing would need further improvements in inflation to justify. If inflation remains sticky for longer, then a material deterioration of growth would be needed for consecutive ECB cuts, but for this, more convincing data is needed. Eurozone unemployment numbers will also be released tomorrow, but even if the number ticks up from 6.5% to 6.6%, the level will still be at historic lows. Having said that, EUR rate markets may be more sensitive to US growth numbers, as the upside surprise in US GDP growth today was enough to fully offset the morning's decline in 10Y yields. Friday's events and market views Plenty of important data, including the US PCE index, and eurozone inflation and unemployment numbers. The core PCE deflator is expected to come in at 0.2% month-on-month, with not a single economist forecasting 0.3%. Other data from the US includes the Chicago PMI, Michigan indices and personal income and spending figures.

    "title": "Officers To Get Allowances In Digital Rupee Wallets? Know All About RBI's Plan",
    "text": "New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is taking a significant step to promote its central bank digital currency (CBDC) by piloting its use internally. In a recent decision, the RBI has opted to credit a portion of reimbursements for internet and data charges directly to the CBDC wallets of its officers. This initiative is part of a broader plan to encourage the adoption of retail digital currency and evaluate its practical usability. CBDC, often seen as a counter to cryptocurrencies, is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency issued by the central bank. Unlike conventional deposits held in bank accounts, CBDC represents a direct liability of the central bank. This distinction sets it apart from the usual banking framework, as CBDC does not generate interest for its holders. According to Economic Times report citing an internal RBI communication dated December 27, this initiative aims to scale up the retail pilot of the CBDC and familiarize officers with the use of digital wallets. A user manual has been distributed to guide officers on updating their wallets. The RBI launched its pilot program for retail digital currency, also known as the e-Rupee, in December 2022. Despite its potential, CBDC adoption among retail users has been sluggish. With widespread acceptance of UPI and mobile payment platforms like GPay, CBDC has yet to gain significant traction. Moreover, the absence of interest on digital wallets and the lack of active promotion by banks have further limited its appeal. According to Economic Times report citing the banker, \"People might be more open to using CBDC if they can link it with UPI or other payment apps for seamless transactions. However, the fact that wallet balances don’t earn interest and banks aren’t enthusiastic about promoting CBDC wallets could be deterrents.\" The RBI’s latest move comes shortly after the appointment of a new governor, signaling a renewed push for digital currency. While the RBI has not announced plans for expanding this reimbursement initiative, the success of the current experiment could pave the way for broader usage among employees. Globally, CBDC has sparked debates about its potential benefits and risks. Advocates highlight its ability to make cross-border fund transfers faster and cheaper. However, monetary authorities, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have raised concerns about its macroeconomic implications. Some key challenges include the risk of deposit withdrawals from banks during financial stress, difficulties in liquidity forecasting due to demand volatility, and potential disruptions to central banks’ monetary policy operations. Moreover, while CBDC could streamline cross-border payments, it might also lead to volatile capital flows and amplify financial shocks across markets.

    "text": "HE is on a mission to help our pets . . . and is here to answer YOUR questions. Sean, who is the head vet at tailored pet food firm tails.com, has helped with owners’ queries for ten years. 4 Sean helps a reader whose dog rolls in fresh-cut grass Credit: Getty 4 Sean McCormack, head vet at tails.com, promises he can 'help keep pets happy and healthy' He says: “If your pet is acting funny or is under the weather, or you want to know about nutrition or exercise, just ask. I can help keep pets happy and healthy.” WHAT can I do to stop my Labradoodle Teddy rolling in fresh-cut grass? He is a high-energy two-year-old but he comes out green and I’m worried it’s not good for him. Could it irritate his skin? TOM CASTLE, Middlesbrough READ MORE PET NEWS FOREST ESCAPE Girl & boy survive 96 HOURS in bear-infested forest as dogs scared off beasts CLAWS OUT Three-day warning for pet owners ahead of big change to rules – key move to make Sean says: Why do you need to rein in his fun? Let him roll. It’s fun, and it’s funny to have a green Labradoodle. Let him express himself as the big, fluffy, joyous goofball he is. There’s no reason for this to cause him any harm, unless he has allergies and skin problems from doing so, or unless the grass has been sprayed with chemicals. Sometimes as dog owners I think we get a little too caught up in having the “perfect dog” to the detriment of allowing them to actually be dogs. Roll away, Teddy, roll away! MY cat really dislikes my boyfriend. Most read in Money SHUTTERS DOWN Major fashion retailer suddenly closes flagship Scottish store HAPPY MEAL McDonald’s to add six news items to menus in DAYS in big Monopoly shakeup LAST CHANCE Martin Lewis' MSE reveal top tip for Tesco shoppers - but they must act TODAY PIZZA THE ACTION First look at new Italian with a twist that's just opened in Glasgow Eight-year-old Bengal Jed is lovely with everyone but seems jealous of him and gives him the cold shoulder. What can I do to get them to bond? He’s tried treats. I’m thinking of covering my boyfriend in catnip I’m so desperate for Jed to like him. How to keep pets safe during a heatwave SARA BROWN, Sevenoaks, Kent Sean says: Tell your boyfriend to completely ignore Jed. No eye contact, no pleading for attention or trying to stroke him. Complete indifference. Nothing gets a nonchalant cat more interested than when someone gives them the cold shoulder. It will take time but I bet before long Jed will start taking an interest. When he does, get your boyfriend to walk around occasionally dropping Jed’s favourite treats (or catnip) near him, but not directly giving it to him or forcing it on him. Jed will quickly learn this guy’s a keeper. OUR Siberian husky Boss has been diagnosed with diabetes. I’m worried about glaucoma as I’ve been warned it can happen. Are there any steps I can take to minimise risks? PETE SMITH, Windsor, Berks Sean says: The best way to prevent any side effects of diabetes is to manage the condition well. Your vet team will help you gain confidence and knowledge in how to do so. It will involve taking care of Boss’s eating habits and weight, and injecting him with insulin at meal times. But don’t worry, it’s the tiniest needle ever and for a tough Husky, not a bother. You’ll be a professional in no time, and with a bit of luck Boss will have a good long life free of any complications. Remember your vet team will be there to help you. FELIX my cat bullies my great Dane Frank. He sits in his bed and, honestly, Frank is terrified of him. Should I consider separating them when I’m out of the house? Is there anything you can recommend to stop Felix’s behaviour? Frank is such a good-natured boy, which is why Felix is ruling the roost. SARAH COOPER, Leeds Sean says: Unless they are actually scrapping, I would just respect the natural order of things. Dogs drool and cats rule. Isn’t that what they said in that childhood favourite movie of mine, Homeward Bound? If you’ve not seen it, check it out. Feelgood stuff. But I digress. Frank will just have to learn to get around Felix. I know being a great Dane, Frank’s bed won’t have been cheap or easy to find room for. But you are going to have to buy him another and place it somewhere else in the house. Felix can’t commandeer two beds at once.

Investing in specialised equipment designed for cycling with pets, such as hands-free leads or harnesses that attach securely to your bike, is vital too.

    "title": "Britain targets the wealthy as it hikes taxes by $52 billion | CNN Business",
    "text": "The United Kingdom is raising taxes by an eye-watering £40 billion ($52 billion), as the government seeks to plug a hole in its finances by targeting higher earners, wealthy foreigners and businesses. UK finance minister Rachel Reeves, the first woman to ever hold the position, unveiled the measures Wednesday in the ruling Labour Party’s first budget since it won a landslide victory in a general election in July. “Today, I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services,” Reeves said, arguing that the now-opposition Conservative Party had “failed” Britain, including by inadequately budgeting for required government spending. “The British people have inherited their failure. A black hole in the public finances. Public services on their knees. A decade of low (economic) growth. And the worst parliament for living standards in modern history,” she added. Reeves called her predecessor Jeremy Hunt’s £10 billion ($13 billion) cut to payroll taxes, which he unveiled in March months ahead of the election, “the height of economic irresponsibility,” contrasting her own budget as charting a “responsible” course while making tough but necessary trade-offs. Reeves had few easy options. Britain has suffered years of lackluster economic growth, low levels of business investment and only tepid improvements in living standards. A mounting public debt burden — virtually the same size as the economy — means that ever more of the government’s budget is hoovered up by borrowing costs, leaving less for crumbling public services, including the stricken National Health Service. Before its election victory, Reeves’ Labour Party had pledged to keep taxes on working people “as low as possible,” promising to not raise income tax, sales taxes or payroll taxes. On Wednesday, the government targeted higher earners instead, announcing plans to tax inherited pensions and unveiling increases to capital gains tax, which is paid on the profits made when selling investment properties and financial assets such as shares. Reeves also said the government would move ahead with plans, first announced by Hunt, to abolish the non-domiciled tax regime that applies to people who live in the UK without paying tax in the country because they claim to have permanent residence abroad. The government will instead introduce a new tax system for such individuals, raising £12.7 billion ($16.5 billion) over the next five years. Reeves also confirmed plans to scrap a 20% tax break on private school fees and remove the relief that private schools currently enjoy on taxes on commercial properties known as business rates. The biggest revenue-raiser will be an increase to employers’ National Insurance contributions, which companies pay for each salaried worker they employ. The tax hike will eventually raise £25 billion ($33 billion) per year. The government has also reduced the threshold at which that levy is paid, although small businesses will be exempt from the changes.",

    "title": "Revealed: SA’s negative gearing hotspots",
    "text": "Negative gearing is a popular wealth-building approach for many, and new data reveals the South Australian suburbs where it is most popular, and in which suburbs it has surged in recent years. According to PropTrack data, Adelaide’s southern suburbs have recorded the greatest increase in the number of properties now negatively geared, with Aldinga recording the biggest jump – up 21.8 per cent to 63.1 per cent from the 41.3 per cent recorded in April 2022. Morphett Vale, Christies Beach and Woodcroft have recorded jumps of 20.3 per cent, 17.1 per cent and 15.9 per cent respectively. The data is based on interest repayments on rental listings advertised since 2019 and excludes other claims for other losses like maintenance. The Greens recently proposed limiting negative gearing rules to a single investment property and prime minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton both face pressure to revisit tax incentives on investment properties before the next federal election. But Treasurer Jim Chalmers poured water on The Greens’ push, saying the federal government was not considering changes to negative gearing and capital gains. Master Builders Australia chief executive officer Denita Wawn condemned the proposed changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax arrangements, saying they would have a negative effect on housing supply. “Across the whole housing spectrum, the common constraint is supply,” Ms Wawn said. “In order to put downward pressure on housing inflation and high rents, we need to build more homes. Master Builders Australia chief executive officer Denita Wawn. Supplied “The Henry Tax Review, Productivity Commission and Reserve Bank of Australia have all said curtailing investor incentives like negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts reduces housing supply rather than improve it. “With the current downturn in new building approvals and investments in new housing, why we would take a sledgehammer to investors including mums and dads beggars belief.” Back to the data, Hyde Park has the highest proportion of its investment properties negatively geared at 96.2 per cent, with the typical loss being $11,586. Beaumont wasn’t far behind, with 93.3 per cent of all properties in the suburbs owned as investments negatively geared. The average loss for these is far greater however – the fourth highest in the state, in fact – at $27,647. The highest losses per year – $31,303 – were recorded for Walkerville homes, where 50.9 per cent of investment properties were negatively geared. When it comes to SA’s councils, Burnside has the highest proportion of negatively geared investment properties at 75.2 per cent, ahead of Unley’s 68.9 per cent and Campbelltown’s 67.3 per cent. Mike Lao, Director/Sales, Edge Realty. Edge Realty director Mike Lao said any decisions regarding potential changes to negative gearing needed to be carefully considered. “Removing it might make it unaffordable for people to buy investments, which could later on lead to them being reliant on the pension which would be another burden on the government, so negative gearing’s a bit of short-term pain for a long-term gain,” he said. “I can see both sides of it, but I’d like to see them leave it the way it is.” MORE NEWS Surprising reason these houses won’t sell SA’s grim reality: $180k wage can’t buy most homes SA’s housing most unaffordable in the nation “If they took away negative gearing it could push rents up, or could force people to sell up and move their money into shares. “It might create a small influx of supply in the short term but in the long-term, where is the rest of the supply going to keep coming from?” Mr Lao, who sells in the northern suburbs, said he had seen an increase in the number of negatively geared properties there in recent months as month after month of interest rate rises had reduced the number of cashflow-positive homes in the area. David Nguyen, Oanh Luong and family outside their Glynde home. The couple own an investment property in Vale Park. Pic: The Advertiser/Morgan Sette Mortgage broker David Nguyen, 38, of Glynde and his wife Oanh, 37, have a negatively geared investment property in Vale Park and Mr Nguyen said he was happy with how the investment strategy was working for them. “If they scrapped it we’d still keep it, because negative gearing can be taken away at anytime,” he said. “It’s great to have but we don’t have the property for just that reason – we look at the capital gains as well. “It is beneficial, but we treat negative gearing as a bonus and not as our primary consideration.”",

    "title": "Bed Bath & Beyond is returning to brick and mortar stores — at a rival",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Bed Bath & Beyond is coming back to a physical store near you after going out of business last year. But this time, it’s taking up space at a rival. Beyond Inc., which bought the defunct retailer out of bankruptcy, is investing $40 million in the Container Store and giving the home goods and former competitor a much-needed lifeline as it struggles with its own financial issues. As part of the investment, Bed Bath & Beyond branded kitchen, bath and bedroom products will soon be sold at the Container Store’s 102 locations. The partnership aims to “improve customer experience utilizing both the iconic” Bed Bath & Beyond and the Container Store names, a press release said, which are two of the most recognizable names in shopping that have fallen into a financial mess in recent years. In May, the Container Store began a strategic review of its business as it struggles with slumping sales and hasn’t posted a profit in three years. A few months later, the chain said it would stop offering financial guidance as it searched for help. For Bed Bath & Beyond ( BYON ), its rebirth from a bankrupt physical retailer to an e-commerce giant hasn’t lived up to its expectations. Last year, its name and digital assets were purchased by Overstock.com , prompting parent company Beyond Inc. to ditch the Overstock brand. However, that decision was reversed in July. “Through the licensing of the Bed Bath & Beyond brand, the Container Store will enhance their store format and current general merchandise offering by incorporating the most popular Bed Bath & Beyond products to drive improved financial performance while providing customers a more comprehensive product offering for their home and organizational needs,” said Marcus Lemonis, Beyond Inc.’s executive chairman, in a release. Shares of the Container Store ( TCS ) soared 40% in premarket trading Wednesday.",

    "title": "Talos Energy Announces Third Quarter 2024 Operational and Financial Results",
    "text": "HOUSTON , Nov. 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Talos Energy Inc. (\"Talos\" or the \"Company\") TALO today announced its operational and financial results for fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Recent Key Highlights Production of 96.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"MBoe/d\") (70% oil, 80% liquids), at the high-end of third quarter 2024 guidance range. Reduced debt by $100 million , bringing leverage to 0.9x*. Commenced drilling at the high-impact Katmai West #2 well in the Gulf of Mexico to further appraise the field, potentially adding additional proved reserves over the initial discovery well in the west fault block, Katmai West #1 well. Discovered commercial quantities of oil and natural gas at the Ewing Bank 953 well, with first production expected in mid-2026. Purchased a 21.4% non-operated working interest (\"W.I.\") in the Monument discovery located in the Walker Ridge area in the Gulf of Mexico . Re-completed the 100% Talos-owned Brutus A3 well yielding a peak production rate of over 30 million cubic feet per day (\"MMcf/d\"). Improved 2024 production guidance with revised estimate of 91.0 – 94.0 Mboe/d and lowered 2024 capital expenditures guidance to $510 - $530 million . Third Quarter Summary Revenue of $509.3 million , driven by realized prices (excluding hedges) of $74.72 per barrel for oil, $19.42 per barrel for natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\"), and $2.39 per thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\") for natural gas. Net Income of $88.2 million , or $0.49 Net Income per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Loss* of $25.6 million , or $0.14 Adjusted Net Loss per diluted share*. Adjusted EBITDA* of $324.4 million . Capital expenditures of $118.9 million , excluding plugging and abandonment and settled decommissioning obligations. Net cash provided by operating activities of $227.0 million . Adjusted Free Cash Flow* of $121.5 million . Talos Interim President and Chief Executive Officer Joseph Mills stated, \"For the third quarter 2024, we are proud to report that we achieved another consecutive quarter of record production of 96.5 MBoe/d, along with strong Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. This is a testament to our team's focus on delivering results. Our solid cash flow generation enabled us to continue making strides in reducing our debt and attain 0.9x leverage, below our target leverage of 1.0x. We remain focused on paying down the balance of our debt under the Bank Credit Facility by year end 2024. Since closing the QuarterNorth acquisition in March 2024 , we have repaid $425 million of debt, demonstrating our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. \"Regarding our drilling and recompletion program, we are pleased with the results of the re-completion at the 100% Talos-owned Brutus A3 well in July 2024 , which yielded a peak production rate of over 30 MMcf/d during the third quarter. We are also pleased about the previously announced Ewing Bank 953 well results in September 2024 and the acquired non-operated stake in the Monument deepwater discovery in August 2024 . We logged better than expected rock properties at our Ewing Bank 953 well, which we anticipate will be producing by mid-2026. Our participation in the non-operated Monument project, a large deepwater oil and gas discovery in the Wilcox trend, presents an attractive post-FID subsea tie-back opportunity, including a potential drilling opportunity beyond the appraised discovery. \"Additionally, we recently began drilling the first of three consecutive high-impact subsalt wells utilizing the West Vela deepwater drillship, starting with the Katmai West #2 appraisal well in October 2024 , to be followed by the Daenerys and Helm's Deep prospects in 2025. We are placing a strong emphasis on operational execution and capital discipline as we embark on a very important drilling campaign. \"I'm honored to have stepped in as interim CEO of Talos at the beginning of September 2024 , allowing me the opportunity to work more closely with our highly skilled and talented employees to achieve these results. The Board, in partnership with an external search firm, is diligently searching for a new CEO who can build on Talos's strong foundation and lead the Company into its next phase of growth. I have the utmost confidence in our management team, Board, and the future direction and strategy of the Company. Talos's management team and Board are laser-focused on executing our strategic initiatives and maximizing long-term stockholder value. I'm pleased to be here to ensure a seamless transition until a permanent CEO is named.\" Footnotes: *See \"Supplemental Non-GAAP Information\" for details and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OPERATIONS UPDATE Production Updates: Katmai: In October 2024 , the Seadrill-owned drillship West Vela commenced drilling the Katmai West #2 well which will further appraise the field, potentially adding additional proved reserves. The well is expected to reach total depth early in the first quarter 2025. In preparation of the completion of Katmai West #2 well, modifications to the host facility, Tarantula, have been completed between October and November 2024 , and has increased capacity from 27 MBoe/d to 35 MBoe/d. Talos projects achieving first production from the Katmai West #2 well in the second quarter 2025. We anticipate the Katmai wells will be rate-constrained under the upgraded capacity allowing for extended flat-to-low decline production from the facility. Talos holds a 50% W.I. and Ridgewood Energy holds a 50% W.I. in Katmai. Talos is the 100% owner and operator of the Tarantula facility. Sunspear Completion: In October 2024 , Talos secured a rig contract for Transocean's Deepwater Conqueror to complete the Sunspear discovery. The Sunspear well, successfully drilled in July 2023 , is expected to commence first production during the second quarter 2025, with production flowing to the Talos operated Prince platform. The initial gross production rate is estimated to be between 8 – 10 Mboe/d. Talos holds a 48.0% W.I., an entity managed by Ridgewood Energy Corporation holds a 47.5% W.I., and Houston Energy holds a 4.5% W.I. Brutus Re-completion: In July 2024 , the 100% Talos-owned Brutus A-3 well was re-completed to the E1/E2 sand, yielding higher rates than expected, and reached a peak production rate of over 30 million cubic feet per day. Exploitation and Exploration Updates: Ewing Bank 953 : In September 2024 , Ewing Bank 953 well encountered approximately 127 feet of net pay in the target sand at approximately 19,000 feet true vertical depth. Preliminary data indicates an estimated gross recoverable resource potential of approximately 15 – 25 million barrels of oil equivalent (\"MMBoe\") from a single subsea well with an initial gross production rate of 8 – 10 MBoe/d. First production is expected in mid-2026. Current plans are for the well to be tied back to the South Timbalier 311 Megalodon host platform, which Talos partially owns. Talos holds a 33.3% W.I., with Walter Oil & Gas Corp. as operator holding a 56.7% W.I. and Gordy Oil Company holding a 10.0% W.I. Monument Discovery : In August 2024 , Talos acquired a 21.4% W.I. in Monument, a large Wilcox oil discovery located in Walker Ridge blocks 271, 272, 315, and 316, for a purchase price of $32 million . Monument will be developed as a subsea tie-back to the Shenandoah production facility in Walker Ridge. The Monument discovery is post-FID with appraised proved plus probable gross reserves of approximately 115 million barrels of oil equivalent. First production is expected between 20 – 30 MBoe/d gross by late 2026 under restricted flow due to facility rate-constraints. The proved and probable PV-10 of Monument's reserves is valued at approximately $265 million (1) . There is an additional 25 – 35 MMBoe drilling location adjacent to the discovery that could extend the resource. Talos expects a net investment of approximately $25 million in 2024 and approximately $160 million over 2025 and 2026. Other partners include Beacon as operator with a 30.0% W.I., Navitas Petroleum with a 28.6% W.I., and Repsol E&P USA Inc. with a 20.0% W.I. Daenerys: Talos expects to utilize the West Vela drillship to drill the Daenerys exploration well following the Katmai West #2 well. The Daenerys well is a high-impact subsalt project that will evaluate the regionally prolific Middle and Lower Miocene section and carries an estimated gross resource potential between 100 – 300 MMBoe. The prospect is part of a broader farm-in transaction executed in 2023 that totals approximately 23,000 gross acres in the Walker Ridge area. The well is expected to spud in the first quarter 2025. Talos holds a 27% W.I. and partners include Red Willow , Houston Energy, and Cathexis. Helm's Deep : Talos plans to mobilize the West Vela drillship to Helms Deep after completing drilling operations at Daenerys. The West Vela is expected to commence drilling at Helms Deep, an amplitude-supported, near-infrastructure subsalt Pliocene exploitation well, in the third quarter 2025. The Helms Deep well has a proposed depth of approximately 18,000 feet and an estimated gross resource potential between 17 - 27 MMBoe. Talos is targeting a 50.0% W.I. Sebastian : Drilling of the Sebastian prospect in the third quarter 2024 encountered non-commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and has been plugged and abandoned. Talos held a 25.0% W.I., with Murphy Oil Corporation as operator holding a 26.8% W.I., Westlawn Americas Offshore a 18.2% W.I, Alta Mar Energy holding a 20.0% W.I., and Houston Energy holding a 10.0% W.I. Other Business Developments Common Stock Repurchase Program: Year-to-date 2024, Talos repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of common stock for approximately $45.1 million . As of September 30, 2024 , there is $157.5 million remaining under the authorized plan. The timing of future repurchases under the share repurchase program will depend on market conditions, contractual limitations, and other considerations. The program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares. Limited Duration Stockholder Rights Plan: In October 2024 , Talos's Board adopted a limited duration stockholder rights Plan (the \"Rights Plan\"). The Board adopted the Rights Plan solely in response to the continued accumulation of approximately 24% of shares of Talos common stock by Control Empresarial De Capitales (\"Control Empresarial\"). The Rights Plan is similar to those adopted by other publicly traded companies and is intended to enable all Talos stockholders to realize the long-term value of their investment and protect Talos from any future efforts to obtain control of Talos that are inconsistent with the best interests of its stockholders. Control Empresarial has been an important Talos stockholder and Talos will continue to maintain an active and constructive dialogue with Control Empresarial. Audit Committee Internal Review : In September 2024 , the Company received notification from an external third party suggesting a mid-level employee was engaged in inappropriate procurement practices. In response, the Audit Committee of the Company's board of directors, conducted a review of such alleged practices by engaging independent external legal counsel to assist in reviewing the matter and determining the extent of such activities. Such review with external legal counsel did not identify or implicate other current or former employees and the employee was separated from the Company. The Audit Committee also has not identified any related material errors in the historical financial statements. Talos plans to file an amended Form 10-K/A to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our \"Annual Report\"), and an amended Form 10-Q/A for each of the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 , and June 30, 2024 , (together, our \"Quarterly Reports\"), respectively, to amend and restate certain disclosures. These amended disclosures will address the material weaknesses identified at the end of 2023 in our internal controls over our financial reporting practices and investors can continue to rely on numbers previously disclosed. Notwithstanding the identified material weakness, management has concluded that the financial statements included in our Annual Report and Quarterly reports present fairly, in all material respects, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in accordance with GAAP. The Company expects to file these amendments and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter end September 30, 2024 , on November 12, 2024 .

On September 30, 2024, Talos had $1,375.0 million in total debt. Net Debt * was $1,329.5 million . Net Debt to Pro Forma Last Twelve Months (\"LTM\") Adjusted EBITDA * was 0.9x. OPERATIONAL & FINANCIAL GUIDANCE UPDATES Talos provided the following updates to it previously issued 2024 operational and financial guidance: Improved average daily production guidance to 91.0 - 94.0 MBoe/d (71% oil) for the full year 2024. Cash Operating Expenses and Workovers guidance of $555 - $585 million , inclusive of a $14 million service credit recognized in the third quarter 2024, which was previously held as an asset on Talos's balance sheet. Total General & Administrative expenses, including both expense and capitalized costs, remains in line with prior guidance. Talos increased its G&A Expense range to $120 - $130 million to reflect a higher expense ratio, with offsetting savings recognized in capital expenditures guidance. The increased range also accounts for various other one-time expenses. Capital Expenditures guidance was reduced significantly to $510 - $530 million , reflecting updated project timing and capitalized G&A cost reductions. P&A, Decommissioning range increased to $100 - $110 to reflect the acceleration of selected non-operated activities into 2024 from previously planned 2025. Interest Expense guidance of $175 - $185 million , excluding a $4.9 million one-time fee recognized earlier in 2024 as part of the QuarterNorth transaction financings. Talos expects to maintain a long-term leverage ratio below 1.0x. The following summarizes Talos's updated disclosed full-year 2024 operational and production guidance.

Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described herein occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this communication are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this communication. PRODUCTION ESTIMATES Estimates for our future production volumes are based on assumptions of capital expenditure levels and the assumption that market demand and prices for oil and gas will continue at levels that allow for economic production of these products. The production, transportation, marketing and storage of oil and gas are subject to disruption due to transportation, processing and storage availability, mechanical failure, human error, adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, global political and macroeconomic events and numerous other factors. Our estimates are based on certain other assumptions, such as well performance, which may vary significantly from those assumed. Therefore, we can give no assurance that our future production volumes will be as estimated. RESERVE INFORMATION Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify upward or downward revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. In addition, we use the terms \"gross recoverable resource potential,\" and \"gross reserves,\" in this release, which are not measures of \"reserves\" prepared in accordance with SEC guidelines or permitted to be included in SEC filings. These resource estimates are inherently more uncertain than estimates of proved reserves or other reserves prepared in accordance with SEC guidelines. USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This release includes the use of certain measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) such as, but not limited to, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt to Pro Forma LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Leverage, Adjusted EBITDA excluding hedges. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Reconciliations for non-GAAP measure to GAAP measures are included at the end of this release. Talos Energy Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures which may be reported by other companies. Reconciliation of General and Administrative Expenses to Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses We believe the presentation of Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses provides management and investors with (i) important supplemental indicators of the operational performance of our business, (ii) additional criteria for evaluating our performance relative to our peers and (iii) supplemental information to investors about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted General & Administrative Expenses has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. We define these as the following: General and Administrative Expenses . General and Administrative Expenses generally consist of costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production operations, bad debt expense, equity-based compensation expense, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance. A portion of these expenses are allocated based on the percentage of employees dedicated to each operating segment. ($ thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Reconciliation of General & Administrative Expenses to Adjusted General & Administrative Expenses: Total General and administrative expense $ 41,866 Transaction and other expenses (1) (5,696) Non-cash equity-based compensation expense (3,315) Adjusted General & Administrative Expenses $ 32,855 ________________ (1) Transaction expenses includes $4.7 million in severance costs related to the departure of the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer on August 29, 2024. Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA \"EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA\" provide management and investors with (i) additional information to evaluate, with certain adjustments, items required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our debt agreements, (ii) important supplemental indicators of the operational performance of our business, (iii) additional criteria for evaluating our performance relative to our peers and (iv) supplemental information to investors about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. We define these as the following: EBITDA . Net income (loss) plus interest expense; income tax expense (benefit); depreciation, depletion and amortization; and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA plus non-cash write-down of oil and natural gas properties, transaction and other (income) expenses, decommissioning obligations, the net change in fair value of derivatives (mark to market effect, net of cash settlements and premiums related to these derivatives), (gain) loss on debt extinguishment, non-cash write-down of other well equipment and non-cash equity-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA excluding hedges .

Other income (expense) includes restructuring expenses, cost saving initiatives and other miscellaneous income and expenses that we do not view as a meaningful indicator of our operating performance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, it includes an incremental $13.5 million gain on the TLCS Divestiture due to the recognition of contingent consideration as well as a $7.0 million increase in fair value of a service credit acquired via the QuarterNorth Acquisition.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow \" Adjusted Free Cash Flow \" before changes in working capital provides management and investors with (i) important supplemental indicators of the operational performance of our business, (ii) additional criteria for evaluating our performance relative to our peers and (iii) supplemental information to investors about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as alternatives to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. We define these as the following: Capital Expenditures and Plugging & Abandonment . Actual capital expenditures and plugging & abandonment recognized in the quarter, inclusive of accruals. Interest Expense. Actual interest expense per the income statement. Talos did not pay any cash income taxes in the period, therefore cash income taxes have no impact to the reported Adjusted Free Cash Flow before changes in working capital number.

Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings per Share \"Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\" and \"Adjusted Earnings per Share\" are to provide management and investors with (i) important supplemental indicators of the operational performance of our business, (ii) additional criteria for evaluating our performance relative to our peers and (iii) supplemental information to investors about certain material non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings per Share have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Net income (loss) plus accretion expense, transaction related costs, derivative fair value (gain) loss, net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments and non-cash equity-based compensation expense.

Reconciliation of Total Debt to Net Debt and Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA We believe the presentation of Net Debt, LTM Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt to Pro Forma LTM Adjusted EBITDA is important to provide management and investors with additional important information to evaluate our business.

    "text": "JHVEPhoto Listen below or on the go on Apple Podcasts and Spotify Google Payment ( GOOG ) placed under CFPB supervision , company hits back with lawsuit. (00:28) Apollo Global Management ( APO ) and Workday ( WDAY ) set to join S&P 500 . (01:30) Omnicom ( OMC ) is said to near mega-merger with Interpublic. (02:02) This is an abridged transcript of the podcast. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has established supervisory authority over Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Payment, citing \"reasonable cause\" to determine that its conduct poses risks to consumers. The watchdog pointed to Google's practices in investigating allegedly erroneous transactions, and its conduct in connection with the prevention of fraudulent and unauthorized transactions. The CFPB clarified that its order \"does not constitute a finding that the entity has engaged in wrongdoing.\" In response, Google sued the CFPB, claiming the order would subject it to \"burdensome supervision\" and is \"in excess of statutory authority.\" The company claimed that the CFPB relied on \"33 cherry-picked complaints\" involving peer-to-peer payments that it discontinued earlier this year. The CFPB said it relied on 267 consumer complaints, and the regulatory framework for the designation does not specify the degree of risk needed to justify supervision. Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO ) and Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY ) will replace Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ) and Amentum Holdings ( AMTM ) in the S&P 500, respectively, before the open of trading on Monday, December 23 . Qorvo and Amentum Holdings will replace Kelly Services Inc. ( KELYA ) and Service Properties Trust ( SVC ) in the S&P SmallCap 600, respectively.

Terreno Realty ( TRNO ) and Champion Homes ( SKY ) will replace Hudson Pacific Properties ( HPP ) and REGENXBIO ( RGNX ) in the S&P SmallCap 600, respectively. Omnicom Group (NYSE: OMC ) is in advanced talks to buy longtime rival Interpublic Group (NYSE: IPG ) in a deal that would create the world’s biggest advertising company . The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter, that a transaction could be announced as early as this week. Seeking Alpha has sought comment from Omnicom ( OMC ) and Interpublic ( IPG ), and will update this story accordingly. The all-stock agreement is likely to value Interpublic ( IPG ) in a range of $13 billion to $14 billion excluding debt, the Journal reported. Interpublic’s ( IPG ) market value was about $11 billion as of Friday. A combined company would have net revenue of more than $20 billion a year, based on 2023 figures for each company. Omnicom ( OMC ) is the world’s third-largest ad company by revenue, while Interpublic ( IPG ) is the fourth-biggest. A combination would overtake WPP (NYSE: WPP ) as the industry’s biggest player. WPP’s net revenue last year was about $15.1 billion, the Journal reported. Omnicom’s ( OMC ) marquee clients include Disney, Amazon, AT&T and PepsiCo. Interpublic ( IPG ) clients include L’Oréal, Johnson & Johnson and Geico.

    "title": "Weaving the threads of Nigeria’s corporate history, one story at a time",
    "text": "The Nigeria corporate world has been rife with many activities – from launches, to appointments, to expansions, exits, and even takeovers. These activities are threads of the fabric that have woven the corporate landscape of Africa’s largest economy. Sadly, there are few documentations of these pieces of history, thus, these stories are left to remain in the memories of those who lived through them and most likely lost to the coming generation. Related Stories Workplace Economic Outlook 2023: Emerging workplace opportunities Nigerians can explore Thirteen industries to watch out for in Nigeria in 2023 – Ugodre Obi-Chukwu However, this is set to be changed as there is now a book that is weaving the threads of Nigeria’s corporate history – Nigeria Corporate Stories: Tales of Nigerian Boardroom Wins and Losses, Vol. 1 – one story at a time . Written by finance guru, and renowned thought leadership expert in financial and macroeconomic matters, Ugo Obi-Chukwu, and published by Nigeria’s number one finance media house, Nairametrics Financial Advocates , dedicated to providing comprehensive financial, economic, and business content from Nigeria, this book is a must-read for everyone involved in the corporate workings of Nigeria or intends to be. This Volume 1, now on sale on Amazon , is the first installment in the series, having six compelling stories. In the words of Kola Adesina, the Group Managing Director, Sahara Power Group , “ Having served on the Boards of many companies, I have seen the triumphs and tribulations that define corporate leadership.... This book is celebration of the resilience, ingenuity, and audacity that define Nigerian enterprise. It is a tribute to the past, a guide for the present, and a beacon for the future....” Going further, in the foreword to this book, Adesina writes, “...reading the first installment.... I found myself captivated, drawn in by the vivid storytelling that made even familiar tales feel fresh, nuanced, and gripping. Ugo has a remarkable way of recreating these events, as though he were a fly on the wall, privy to every whispered conversation and strategic manoeuvre.” You might not want to take Adesina’s word for it (which you really should), but let me give you a peek into what to expect. The six stories therein are as intense as they are instructive. For one, a story therein tells the incidents that led to the rise of HiTV . Remember this indigenous pay-TV that gave the monopolistic pay-TV a run for their money albeit briefly? Obi-Chukwu weaves the thread to this story from the beginning. You may have lived through this period but how much do you really know? With vivid storytelling, learn what happened behind closed doors that led to the rise and fall of HiTV. Lessons are not only learnt from success stories but from failed efforts. In yet another corporate story therein, you would read of a well-known banking guru who continues to make a name for himself. How did he rise? What incidents shaped him? Did he have setbacks? How is he continuing to make his mark in the high-stake banking terrain of Nigeria? Do not keep guessing. Know the details and be well-informed. Get a copy of this book, Nigeria Corporate Stories: Tales of Nigerian Boardroom Wins and Losses, Vol. 1., and have a front-row seat to the rise and fall of Nigeria’s corporate giants, as well as a glimpse into the forces driving the nation’s economic future.",

    "title": "Billionaire Buffett again sells BofA shares worth about $845 million",
    "text": "(Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has once again cut its stake in Bank of America with a share sale worth roughly $845 million, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. The conglomerate run by one of the world's most revered investors has offloaded shares worth more than a combined $6 billion in the second largest U.S. bank in seven rounds of share sales since July. Berkshire, BofA's top shareholder, disclosed that it had sold roughly 21.1 million shares of the bank between Aug. 28 and Aug. 30. Buffett started investing in the bank in 2011 when Berkshire bought $5 billion of preferred stock. That purchase signaled his confidence in CEO Brian Moynihan's ability to restore the lender to health following the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett, 93, had in April 2023 told CNBC that he liked Moynihan \"enormously\" and did not want to sell the bank's stock at the time. BofA shares have gained 21% so far this year, compared with a 22.6% gain in the S&P 500 Banks Index, which tracks the performance of large-cap banks.

    "title": "Real estate stocks gain as traders look for alternatives to tech stocks",
    "text": "EschCollection/DigitalVision via Getty Images Real estate stocks gained this week as the markets priced in a near certainty of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, and traders started moving out of technology stocks and into other assets such as defensive and value sectors and small-cap stocks. Separately, the odds of former President Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential elections in November have increased following the assassination attempt . A GOP sweep is widely seen as good news for the markets. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF ( NYSEARCA: XLRE ) ended 1.30% higher from last week at 40.51, gaining in three out of the five trading sessions. XLRE is currently trading 8% above its 200-day simple moving average. Dow Jones Equity All REIT Total Return Index rose by 1.58% , while FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs increased 1.23% . Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost ~2% as a soft inflation report on Thursday, July 11, sparked a continued rotation out of the technology stocks. Data center REITs Equinix ( EQIX ) and Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ) were the worst-performing S&P 500 real estate stocks of the week amid the rotation. Earnings The real estate sector kicked off the quarterly earnings season on a positive note. Prologis ( PLD ) bumped up the lower end of its 2024 core FFO guidance, as improving, though subdued, customer demand helped the industrial REIT to post slightly better-than-forecast Q2 earnings. Crown Castle ( CCI ) posted on Wednesday Q2 funds from operations that topped the average analyst estimate, though it continued to retreat both sequentially and from a year earlier. The telecom infrastructure REIT's 2024 outlook remained unchanged from the previous guidance issued on June 11, 2024. Rexford Industrial Realty ( REXR ) slightly raised the low end of its 2024 guidance for core funds from operations, while maintaining the high end of the range. That comes after the industrial REIT's Q2 results came in stronger than Wall Street had expected. First Industrial Realty Trust ( FR ) posted a Q2 beat , SL Green Realty ( SLG ) boosted its 2024 guidance for funds from operations after results and Alpine Income Property Trust ( PINE ) posted earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Earnings are expected to be the focus next week. For next week, the major real estate companies expected to report quarterly earnings are Alexandria Real Estate Equities ( ARE ), Equity LifeStyle Properties ( ELS ), AGNC Investment ( AGNC ), ARMOUR Residential REIT ( ARR ), CoStar Group ( CSGP ), Agree Realty ( ADC ), Highwoods Properties ( HIW ), Brandywine Realty Trust ( BDN ), Invitation Homes ( INVH ), Annaly Capital Management ( NLY ), Essential Properties Realty Trust ( EPRT ), Empire State Realty Trust ( ESRT ), Getty Realty ( GTY ), Pebblebrook Hotel Trust ( PEB ), Digital Realty Trust ( DLR ), CBRE Group ( CBRE ), Weyerhaeuser ( WY ), Healthpeak Properties ( DOC ), Gaming and Leisure Properties ( GLPI ), CTO Realty Growth ( CTO ) and Howard Hughes Holdings ( HHH ). Performance XLRE saw net inflows worth $52.59M last week, compared to outflows worth $0.14M a week ago, data from the information solutions provider VettaFi showed . Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system changed its recommendation on the ETF to Hold from Sell this week, with a health score of 3.02 on a scale of 5. The system assigns XLRE B- for Momentum, A for Expenses, C- for Dividends, D+ for Risk and A+ for Liquidity. SA analysts also grade the fund as Hold. Equity Residential ( EQR ), Essex Property Trust ( ESS ) and Camden Property Trust ( CPT ) drove Residential to log the largest weekly gain among the XLRE subsectors. Meanwhile, the downgrade of Host Hotels & Resorts ( HST ) at J.P. Morgan over high prices led the Hotel subsector to post the largest weekly decline. Here is a look at the subsector performance: More on Real Estate Trumponomics: Trump details plan for economy, Wall Street and foreign policy Rotation: A key phrase in financial markets right now S&P Big Tech ETF paces decliners as S&P 500 heads toward the worst week since April",

    "text": "Continued strong financial results, cash generation, and leverage reduction Revenue up 5% versus prior year period GAAP income from continuing operations up 7%; Adjusted EBITDA up 6% Record-high recurring monthly revenue; solid customer retention On track to achieve full year 2024 guidance metrics BOCA RATON, Fla., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADT Inc. (NYSE: ADT), the most trusted brand in smart home and small business security, today reported results for the third quarter of 2024. Financial highlights for the third quarter are below with variances on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Results of the former commercial and solar segments are presented as discontinued operations, except for cash flow measures. Total revenue increased by 5% to $1.2 billion and end-of-period recurring monthly revenue (RMR) increased 2% to $359 million ($4.3 billion on an annualized basis) Strong customer retention with gross revenue attrition of 12.8% and revenue payback at 2.2 years GAAP income from continuing operations of $132 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, up $9 million Adjusted income from continuing operations of $183 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, up $39 million Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $659 million, up $35 million Year to date net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion up 14%; Adjusted Free Cash Flow (including interest rate swaps) of $520 million up 28% “ADT delivered solid third quarter performance resulting in a record-high recurring monthly revenue balance, healthy customer retention, strong operating profitability, and cash generation.

Closing out the year, we are well positioned to achieve our 2024 commitments, including significant cash flow growth while continuing to invest in our future and return more capital to our shareholders.” Business Highlights Trusted Neighbor launch – ADT’s Trusted Neighbor offering is now available for customers across the US.

Select customers can use the Auto-Unlock feature to automatically verify a trusted individual, enabled by deep integration of the ADT+ app, Google Nest Doorbell’s Familiar Faces technology, and Yale locks. ADT Remote Assistance – The ADT Remote Assistance program continues to generate high customer satisfaction at a lower cost while also eliminating thousands of vehicle trips each day. In the third quarter 2024, over 50% of ADT service requests were virtual. ADT Home Security Program for State Farm – In October, ADT expanded its Home Security Program for State Farm, introducing a new solution in Maryland and Michigan that detects water leaks in common household areas. Building on learnings and customer feedback from earlier pilot launches, ADT continues to develop tailored packages focused on proactive risk detection and strong customer protection. Strategic Bulk Account Purchase – The Company closed on a strategic bulk purchase of approximately 49,000 customer accounts, acquired from the same party as the December 2023 transaction, for $81 million cash with attractive projected returns. This portfolio of customers is concentrated in a few key geographies, all of which align with existing platforms, enabling strong economies of scale upon integration.

Employees celebrated by ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange and volunteering with The Birthday Project, a nonprofit organization that hosts birthday celebrations for unhoused youth. Hurricane Relief Donations – In October, ADT’s Safe Places program donated to local and national organizations such as the American Red Cross, Team Rubicon, and a North Carolina food bank to support relief and recovery efforts in areas affected by recent hurricanes.

This accolade highlights ADT’s commitment to inclusivity with robust accommodations, comprehensive benefits, accessible work environments, and meaningful career advancement opportunities for employees with disabilities. Results of Continuing Operations (1) (2) Total revenue was $1,244 million for the third quarter, up 5%. Monitoring and related services (M&S) revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in average prices. Security installation, product, and other revenue increased primarily due to higher volume of outright sales to new customers and higher amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition revenue under the Company-owned sales model. Income from continuing operations was $132 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, up $9 million. This was primarily attributable to continued growth in revenues and associated margins including cost efficiencies, partially offset by technology investments and higher net interest expense. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $183 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, up $39 million, driven by the same factors noted above excluding the negative impact of interest rate swaps of $54 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $659 million, up $35 million primarily attributable to continued growth in M&S revenues and associated margins including cost efficiencies, partially offset by technology investments. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter was $498 million, up $52 million or 12%, primarily driven by lower cash interest resulting from debt reduction and improved operating performance, partially offset by the net results of the commercial and solar businesses. Adjusted Free Cash Flow (including interest rate swaps) decreased by $13 million, which included a strategic bulk account purchase of $81 million during the quarter, in addition to the drivers above. The Company returned $50 million to shareholders via dividends in the third quarter. Total cash and cash equivalents were $95 million and no amounts were outstanding under the Company’s First Lien Revolving Credit Facility at the end of the quarter. In October, the Company amended and restated its First Lien Credit Agreement with respect to the First Lien Revolving Credit Facility, which extended the maturity date to October 2029, subject to certain conditions, and obtained an additional $225 million of commitments. The new facility reduces interest rates on drawn amounts by 85 basis points and commitment fees by 20 basis points. As of Oct. 24, 2024, approximately $225 million remains available for future share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Plan, net of $32 million of repurchases in October. 2024 Financial Outlook Based on performance through the end of the third quarter, the Company is tightening its 2024 financial guidance within prior guidance ranges. Dividend Declaration Effective Oct. 24, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.055 per share to holders of the Company’s common stock and Class B common stock of record as of Dec. 12, 2024. This dividend will be paid on Jan. 9, 2025. _____________________ Conference Call As previously announced, management will host a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss the Company’s third quarter 2024 results and lead a question-and-answer session.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NON-GAAP MEASURES ADT sometimes uses information (“non-GAAP financial measures”) that is derived from the consolidated financial statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Under SEC rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The following information includes definitions of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures used in this release, reasons management believes these measures are useful to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, additional purposes, if any, for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measures, and limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented following the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The limitations of non-GAAP financial measures are best addressed by considering these measures in conjunction with the appropriate GAAP measures. In addition, computations of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. With regard to the Company’s financial guidance for 2024, the Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation for forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS to GAAP diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (including interest rate swaps) to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, which are the most directly comparable respective GAAP measures. These GAAP measures cannot be reliably predicted or estimated without unreasonable effort due to their dependence on future uncertainties, such as the adjustment of items used in the following reconciliations. Additionally, information not currently available to the Company about other adjusting items could have a potentially unpredictable and potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results. Unless otherwise noted, non-GAAP measures herein reflect the results of only the Company’s continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (including interest rate swaps) reflect the results of both continuing and discontinued operations, which is consistent with the presentation of the GAAP measure net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (including interest rate swaps) exclude amounts related to the exit from the solar business, consistent with the definition of these measures. Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, all cash flows attributable to activities of the solar business are excluded from these measures as the business is substantially wound down. Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow including interest rate swaps The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. The Company defines capital expenditures to include accounts purchased through the Company’s network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of the Company’s authorized dealer network, subscriber system asset expenditures, and purchases of property and equipment. These items are subtracted from cash flows from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow adjusted for net cash flows related to (i) net proceeds from the Company’s consumer receivables facility; (ii) restructuring and integration payments; (iii) integration-related capital expenditures; and (iv) transaction costs and other payments or receipts that may mask operating results or business trends. Adjusted Free Cash Flow including interest rate swaps reflects Adjusted Free Cash Flow plus net cash settlements on interest rate swaps presented outside of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company believes the presentations of these non-GAAP measures are appropriate to provide investors with useful information about the Company’s ability to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is also a useful measure of the cash flow attributable to normal business activities, inclusive of the net cash flows associated with the acquisition of subscribers, as well as the Company’s ability to repay other debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Further, Adjusted Free Cash Flow including interest rate swaps is a useful measure of Adjusted Free Cash Flow inclusive of all cash interest. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures adjust for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash available than the most comparable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. The non-GAAP measures in the table below include cash flows associated with both continuing and discontinued operations consistent with the applicable GAAP presentation on the Statement of Cash Flows. Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding _______________________ Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted EBITDA Margin”) The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to measure the operational strength and performance of its business. The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful as it provides investors additional information about operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items not core to its operations. Further, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because the Company uses it for evaluating business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing company performance against other peer companies using similar measures. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets; (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions; (v) share-based compensation expense; (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other items; (vii) impairment charges; and (viii) non-cash, non-routine, or other adjustments or charges not necessary to operate our business. There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as it does not include certain significant items which directly affect income (loss) from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure). The discussion above is also applicable to Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding _______________________ Historical Adjusted EBITDA (including discontinued operations) The Company believes the presentation of historical Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company's operating profitability adjusted for certain non-cash items, non-routine items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items that are not core to the Company's operations. Further, the Company believes historical Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because the Company uses it for evaluating business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing company performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. The Company defines historical Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest; (ii) taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets and amortization of dealer and other intangible assets; (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions; (v) share-based compensation expense; (vi) merger, restructuring, integration, and other; (vii) losses on extinguishment of debt; (viii) radio conversion costs net of any related incremental revenue earned; (ix) adjustments related to acquisitions, such as contingent consideration and purchase accounting adjustments, or dispositions; (x) impairment charges; and (xi) other income/gain or expense/loss items such as changes in fair value of certain financial instruments or financing and consent fees. Historical Adjusted EBITDA includes results of the Company's continuing and discontinued operations and reflects the calculation of the measure prior to the Company reporting results of the commercial and solar businesses as discontinued operations. There are material limitations to using historical Adjusted EBITDA as it does not reflect certain significant items, which directly affect net income or loss (the most comparable GAAP measure). Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding _______________________ Adjusted Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted Income (Loss)”) and Adjusted Diluted Income (Loss) per Share from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted Diluted Income (Loss) per Share” or “Adjusted EPS”) The Company defines Adjusted Income (Loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) merger, restructuring, integration, and other; (ii) share-based compensation expense; (iii) unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts not designated as hedges; (iv) impairment charges; (v) non-cash, non-routine, or other adjustments or charges not necessary to operate our business; and (vi) the impact these adjusted items have on taxes. Adjusted Diluted Income (Loss) per share is Adjusted Income (Loss) divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock. When the control number for the GAAP calculation is negative, diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock does not include the assumed conversion of Class B common stock and other potential shares, such as share-based compensation awards, to shares of common stock. The Company believes Adjusted Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Income (Loss) per share are benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. There are material limitations to using these measures, as they do not reflect certain significant items which directly affect income (loss) from continuing operations and related per share amounts (the most comparable GAAP measures). Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding. _______________________ Leverage Ratios Net Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of net debt to last twelve months (“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Net debt is calculated as total debt excluding the Receivables Facility, including capital leases, minus cash and cash equivalents. Refer to the discussion on Adjusted EBITDA for descriptions of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss) from continuing operations, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes Net Leverage Ratio is a useful measure of the Company's credit position and progress towards leverage targets. There are material limitations to using Net Leverage Ratio as the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding _______________________ (1) Excludes Solar finance leases consistent with the GAAP presentation as a discontinued operation. (2) Includes debt related to Solar business. (3) Debt instruments are stated at face value. Historical Leverage Ratios Historical Net Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of net debt to LTM Historical Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total debt excluding the Receivables Facility, including capital leases, minus cash and cash equivalents. Refer to the discussion on Historical Adjusted EBITDA for descriptions of the differences between Historical Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes Net Leverage Ratio is a useful measure of the Company's credit position and progress towards leverage targets. There are material limitations to using Net Leverage Ratio as the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Historical Leverage Ratio includes results of the Company's continuing and discontinued operations and reflects the calculation of the measure prior to the Company reporting results of the commercial and solar businesses as discontinued operations. Note: amounts may not sum due to rounding _______________________ (1) Debt instruments are stated at face value.",

    "title": "Baht poised to dip further if Trump wins",
    "text": "The baht will continue to depreciate amid ongoing outflows ahead of the US presidential election early next month to possibly trade below 34.50 baht to the dollar if the Republican candidate Donald Trump is victorious, says Kasikorn Research Centre (K-Research). The Thai currency fell to 33.84 against the greenback, the lowest level in more than one and a half months, during Thursday's morning trade, down from Tuesday's close of 33.50, as other regional currencies also weakened compared to the dollar. \"There are fund outflows from the Thai stock and bond markets while the dollar receives support from US bond yields as the Federal Reserve [Fed] has sent several signals that the central bank will cut the interest rates gradually,\" said Kanjana Chockpisansin, head of research, banking and the financial sector at the think tank. Yields for the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note rose to their highest level since July 25 on Wednesday, hitting 4.26% in morning trade, due to concerns that the tight November election may put further pressure on bonds. \"If Mr Trump wins, there is a possibility that his government will spend a lot or borrow more money. That would make it harder for the US to reduce inflation and affect the Fed's interest rate cut,\" she told the Bangkok Post. \"All of those factors support the dollar strengthening compared to Asian currencies, including the renminbi [yuan],\" Ms Kanjana added. So far, K-Research has maintained the in-house view of Kasikorn Bank that the Fed will trim US rates by 0.25% at each of its two remaining meetings this year in November and December. Meanwhile, the Bank of Thailand is expected to maintain its policy rates at its meeting in December following a 25-basis-point dip this month, she noted. \"We think the Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee [MPC] will make its decision on rates based on the Thai context rather than the Fed's moves.\" Kavee Chukitkasem, head of research and content at Pi Securities, said funds continue to flow out of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) ahead of the US election on Nov 5, while the SET's current price-to-earnings ratio is not cheap in the view of institutional investors. \"Uncertainties concerning the US election are prompting investors to divest risky assets such as stocks or debt instruments, and increase their holdings of safer assets, particularly the dollar and gold. But, normally, stocks will rebound post-election no matter who wins it,\" he said.",

    "title": "India’s self-employed: Bridging the insurance gap with tech-enabled solutions",
    "text": "India is home to over 300 million self-employed individuals, accounting for nearly 50% of the workforce. This diverse group includes gig workers, small business owners, freelancers, and independent professionals like doctors, lawyers, and architects, among others. Self-employment is the largest source of employment in India, playing a crucial role in driving the economy. The government, through various initiatives, is focusing on fostering self-reliance. Despite their immense contributions, self-employed individuals face significant challenges in securing financial protection, particularly in accessing adequate term life insurance coverage. Challenges faced by the self-employed Unlike salaried employees who often benefit from employer-sponsored insurance plans or regular incomes, self-employed individuals encounter several hurdles in obtaining term life insurance. Key challenges include: : Many self-employed individuals experience fluctuating earnings. For instance, a store owner, lawyer, or small workshop operator may see varied monthly incomes based on business conditions. Similarly, chartered accountants (CAs) might earn significantly more during tax-filing seasons and less during off-peak months. Such irregularity complicates insurers’ ability to assess eligibility. : Life insurers typically rely on formal financial documents like salary slips or income tax returns to determine a person’s income stream. However, many self-employed individuals lack such documentation, making it difficult to secure coverage reflective of their actual earnings. : Irregular incomes lead insurers to question the premium-paying capacity or Human Life Value (HLV) of self-employed individuals. As a result, many face rejections or inadequate coverage offers. This exclusionary approach leaves a large portion of the population underinsured or uninsured, exposing families to financial risks in case of untimely deaths. The problem is especially acute for women in non-metro areas—73.5% of rural women and 43.2% of urban women are self-employed. Leveraging technology for better underwriting The insurance industry has been quick to adopt artificial intelligence and tech-driven solutions to address customer-centric challenges. To better serve the self-employed segment, insurers can integrate alternative data sources into their underwriting models. : Bank transaction records, GST filings, UPI payments, and other digital trails can replace traditional documentation like ITRs or salary slips. : Advanced AI models can evaluate diverse data points—spending habits, loan repayment history, and more—to create holistic risk profiles. Automating this process allows insurers to account for the unique income patterns of professions like lawyers, CAs, or gig workers. : Based on these personalized risk profiles, insurers can offer dynamic premium pricing that aligns with an individual’s income seasonality, fostering inclusivity. An inclusive insurance ecosystem Policymakers, insurers, and financial institutions must collaborate to prioritize the insurance needs of this underserved segment. Insurers need to move away from a one-size-fits-all model and embrace strategies that reflect the realities of India’s self-employed workforce. Life insurance, often considered a “push product,\" continues to see low penetration in India, hovering around 3%. Rigid systems risk alienating self-employed Indians who are increasingly seeking financial security. By adopting tech-enabled underwriting and tailored policies, insurers can contribute to IRDAI’s ambitious goal of achieving “Insurance for All by 2047.\" A robust, inclusive insurance ecosystem will not only enhance financial security for millions but also help build a more stable future for the nation.",

    "text": "NEW YORK and ALEXANDRIA, Va., Sept. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Overall commercial bankruptcy filings increased 8 percent in August 2024 to 2,562 from 2,358 in August 2023, according to data provided by Epiq AACER , the leading provider of U.S. bankruptcy filing data. August 2024 commercial chapter 11 filings decreased 3 percent to 616 from the 635 filings in August 2023. The number of distressed small businesses electing to file for subchapter V of chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code increased 5 percent to 185 last month from 176 registered in August 2023. The 45,131 total U.S. bankruptcy filings in August 2024 increased 8 percent from the August 2023 total of 41,642. Individual bankruptcy filings also registered an 8 percent increase, to 42,569 in August 2024 from the August 2023 individual total of 39,284. The number of consumers filing for chapter 7 increased 11 percent to 25,432 in August 2024 from the 22,888 who filed for chapter 7 last August, while chapter 13 filings increased 4 percent to 17,056 in August 2024 from the 16,338 chapter 13 filings in August 2023. “August new filing volumes remained relatively flat month-over-month to end the summer while year-over-year volumes continue to show a steady increase,” said Michael Hunter , vice president of Epiq AACER. “As delinquency rates increase in many domains, debt levels continue to grow, high interest rates remain intact with relatively flat household income, we expect continued increases in new filing volumes this fall and into the winter of 2024.” August’s total bankruptcy filings represented a 2 percent increase from July’s total of 44,439. Total individual filings for August represented a 1 percent increase from the July 2024 individual filing total of 42,083. Commercial filings registered a 9 percent increase from the July 2024 commercial filing total of 2,356, and commercial chapter 11 filings grew 21 percent over the 511 filings in July 2024. Consumer chapter 13 filings increased 5 percent over the 16,303 filings last month, while chapter 7 filings decreased 1 percent from the 25,716 chapter 7s filed in July 2024. “As debt loads continue to steadily climb, access to the financial lifeline of bankruptcy is imperative for consumers and businesses,” said ABI Executive Director Amy Quackenboss . “ABI remains committed to research focused on improving the availability of a financial fresh start for struggling families and businesses.” ABI recently launched a portal for practitioners and experts to provide their experiences on the real-world impact of small businesses electing to file for subchapter V. The site, available at https://abi.org/subvstories , allows professionals to share videos and written accounts about their experiences with distressed small businesses or creditors who have used or benefited from the subchapter. Subchapter V originally went into effect on February 19, 2020, to provide a more streamlined path for distressed small businesses to restructure their debts. Although it launched with a debt eligibility limit of $2,725,625, Congress increased the subchapter V debt eligibility limit to $7.5 million through the CARES Act in March 2020. Congress subsequently extended the higher debt eligibility limit twice, but despite legislative efforts to extend it further, the limit reset on June 21, 2024, to $3,024,725 due to a statutory sunset. The impact of the lower debt eligibility limit on subchapter V filings has been substantial. Between January 1 and June 21, 2024, there were 1,153 subchapter V cases filed — an increase of 66.2 percent from the same period in 2023. Since then, 391 subchapter V cases have been filed, an increase of only 4.5 percent from last year.

    "title": "GMO Q2 2024 Quarterly Letter",
    "text": "MARHARYTA MARKO Executive Summary In this piece, we attempt to answer a number of questions we have gotten from clients about the impacts that rising levels of passive investing may have had on the stock market. While it is extremely difficult to make conclusive statements about the impact of passive investing, we use our understanding of how stock markets and investors behave to reach some reasonable tentative conclusions. It seems plausible that the increasing share of passive investing might have helped intensify a few features of today's markets - notably the rise of the mega-cap stocks and the underperformance of value and small caps. But any effect was likely quite small, and passive investing cannot change the basic math of investing in the long run. If passive investing helped push up the prices for mega-caps or push down the prices for other stocks in a way that was not justified by their underlying fundamentals, future returns will be better for the undervalued stocks and worse for the overvalued ones. Introduction This has been one of the hardest quarterlies to write that we can remember. 1 One way you can tell is the fact that it is late, even by our pretty relaxed standards of when in a quarter a quarterly letter should come out. For many quarterlies, much of the pain comes during the blank sheet stage of the writing process, when brainstorming what to talk about. In this case, we already had our topic - indeed, we had promised in our last letter that we would talk about the impact of passive investing on the market in our next piece. The problem has instead come from the dilemma of wanting to say fairly definitive things about the impact of passive investing on the stock market when it is exceedingly difficult to make conclusive statements about the effect of a single market change in an environment in which many other things have also changed over the same basic time scale. We can't do a control trial in which we rerun recent history with or without passive investing, nor with and without quantitative market makers, nor pod shops, nor private equity, nor the rise of China as a manufacturing power, for that matter. And given that most of these phenomena have arisen over the same broad time scale, even insofar as there have been clear and important changes to the stock market as they emerged, we can't say conclusively that one or another was the cause. And yet, the shift to passive has unarguably been one of the most profound changes in the stock market ever, and such an important change surely has had some effects. Moreover, passive is not some temporary investing fad like portfolio insurance or SPACs that is unlikely to be with us in the long term. Passive funds have overtaken their active peers for a very good reason - they are much cheaper than active management. This relative cheapness stems from the fact that active and passive funds have very different returns to scale. Both types of funds have very high fixed costs, and therefore benefit meaningfully from increases in size. Active funds, however, have capacity constraints; as AUM grows, a fund's market impact can overshadow the inefficiencies that allow it to make money in the first place. This, combined with the significant ongoing research effort that passive funds don't require, places a (relatively high) floor on how low fees can go. Passive funds make no claim to outperformance, have no capacity constraint, and therefore in the limit can decrease fees until they reflect the fund's marginal cost of running an additional dollar. In a competitive marketplace, passive fees will be lower. As a result, passive is not going away and will probably continue to grow (although we will argue a little later on that it may well grow more slowly than it has to date). So, in this piece we are going to look at five questions about the impact of passive investing that we have been getting from our clients and asking of ourselves. While we can't claim to be utterly certain in our attempts to answer them, we do believe we can come to some reasonable conclusions based on the nature of how stock markets and investors behave. The questions are: Has the rise of passive investing affected market efficiency? Is the increase in passive investing behind the rise of today's mega-caps? Is the increase in passive investing hampering the performance of small cap and value stocks? Is mean reversion slower in the presence of passive investing? Does passive investing create opportunities for active investors? Market Efficiency In our experience, market efficiency comes in different flavors. It is almost certainly the case that equity and fixed income markets have become more informationally efficient over the last couple of decades, a result of technological progress, the widespread adoption of statistical analysis, and the proliferation of data. It is also almost certain that the growth in passive investing has little bearing on the increase in the speed and precision at which new information gets incorporated into prices. In fact, informational efficiency requires active investors. In order for stock prices to incorporate new information, investors must change the price at which they are interested in buying or selling those stocks. Passive investors are inherent price takers - they buy or sell only when cash flows in or out require it, and they do so at whatever the prevailing price is. If Nvidia ( NVDA ) has a blow-out quarter or disappoints dreadfully, an index fund's opinion of it does not change. Any change in Nvidia's share price that is driven by news relevant to Nvidia is driven by active investors. Whether they are traditional long-only managers, multi-strategy pod shops, high-frequency market makers, or retail day traders, any investor who changes their mind about the price they are willing to pay for a share of Nvidia in response to information is definitionally active. This does not mean the relative growth of passive hasn't changed other aspects of market efficiency; the rise of passive investing could, in theory, lead to either a decrease or an increase in exploitable market opportunities. If the people quitting active management were inattentive gamblers with a propensity to pour their life savings into brand names that made them nostalgic, remaining active participants would no longer have these lovely counterparties. On the other hand, if the move to passive was primarily from trained forensic accountants with a penchant for uncovering fraud, markets would become more inefficient, with Wirecards and Enrons cropping up more frequently. There is clearly a greater financial incentive for individuals who systematically lose money to make the switch to passive than for those with a demonstrated track record of success. It isn't obvious that they do (see Exhibit 1). 2 Exhibit 1: Market Moving News As of 5/13/2024 | Source: x.com A large part of the growth in passive investing in the U.S. probably stems from the switch from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans (as can be seen in Exhibit 2). In a defined benefit scheme, a public or private institution contributes to a fund on behalf of its employees, investing this money (often through contracting various active managers) to fund future retirement payments. The company is guaranteeing payments to retirees and is incented to try to reduce the cost of doing so by improving the returns they earn on the assets they set aside against that future liability. Corporate pension managers tend to be trained financial professionals who believe themselves to be good at finding talented investors. Some are and have the track records to prove it. But even those who are not are generally incented to try, since the most obvious way to show how valuable you are to the company is by demonstrating how much money you have saved them by astutely hiring extraordinary managers (or delivering excess returns from an internally managed security portfolio). Exhibit 2: Db/dc Split of Retirement Assets As of 12/31/2023 | Source: Investment Company Institute In contrast, in a defined contribution plan, employees receive (and make) payment in a tax-advantaged account that they themselves are entitled to manage. Here the incentives for the corporation are very different. Any excess returns delivered by active managers that they astutely place into the plan accrue only to participants. While the plan participants would presumably be happy to receive those higher returns, what is much more salient to the sponsoring corporation are the implications should those active managers underperform. In that case, the sponsor runs the risk of participants suing them for their perceived incompetence. Defined contribution plans tend to be managed by committees of HR and legal staff, usually with the help of a specialized pension consultant and an overarching goal of minimizing the chance of getting sued. As it is incredibly difficult to successfully sue over being placed in a cheap passive index fund, it is little surprise that the overwhelming direction of flow in the defined contribution space 3 is to passive strategies, automatically directed to shift over time with employee age (through target date funds). And not only does most of the money in defined contribution plans flow into passive investments, but most plan participants are happy to remain passive in their asset allocation, seldom altering their investments over time or in response to market events (as can be seen in Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3: % Plan Participants Changing Asset Allocation As of 12/31/2023 | Source: Investment Company Institute This flow of retirement assets from active to passive managers is only of consequence to market efficiency if active managers were price- and information-sensitive to begin with. At the macro level, this is almost certainly the case: the asset class mix of active portfolios has historically responded to asset prices. The same cannot be said of passive target date funds, which by construction wholly disregard fluctuations in real bond yields and equity valuation ratios. It is telling that - if not for aging - an investor in such a fund would have had the same equity allocation whether in March of 2009 or March of 2024 despite the equity risk premium differing radically across the two periods. Micro efficiency - how readily information is absorbed within asset classes - has possibly also changed. The manner and extent to which it has depends on which active managers have been passed over, what assets they would have held a different stake in versus passive funds, and how much the rise of passive has changed the behavior of the remaining pool of active managers in each asset class. We will delve into this in some detail in the next few sections, but the answer is murky at best. Whatever the impact of passive investing on market efficiency to date, it is likely to be smaller going forward. The transition to defined contribution is coming to an end. Defined benefit plans (and annuities) have already gone from making up 82% of retirement assets in 1974 to 37% of those assets in 2023, and two thirds of what remains in defined benefit plans are in government-sponsored plans (which tend not to be reallocated). While passive may continue to grow as a fraction of assets outside the pension arena, the profound incentive shift that occurs when assets move from defined benefit to defined contribution is absent. Endowments, foundations, and active retail investors are likely to switch from mutual funds to passive vehicles to make use of liquid, cost-efficient vehicles. But unlike retirement accounts, they are not becoming unconcerned about prices or information when doing so; they will still actively change their asset class mix. If future increases in passive flows have less bearing on the size of passive investing, their impact on market efficiency is likely to be muted. The Rise of the Mega-Caps In our last Quarterly Letter, we spoke at length about increasing market concentration in U.S. equities and its impact on active managers. We did not dwell on the reason for the relative size of these companies, mainly because it isn't a particularly interesting story. The primary driver of the enormous market caps of the Magnificent Seven (Spectacular Six? Fabulous Five?) is - drum roll - the enormity of their EPS growth. Exhibit 4 makes this apparent. Exhibit 4: Enormous Eps Growth Drives Enormous Market Caps As of 5/31/2024 | Source: Compustat, Worldscope, S&P Global, Bloomberg, GMO Fundamentals notwithstanding, some market participants believe that today's mega-caps have been genuine beneficiaries of the rise in passive investing. This belief implies at least one of two things: There was a greater positive demand shock for mega-caps than for other stocks. The price elasticity 4 of mega-caps is inherently lower than that of other equities. The first argument hinges on where passive flows came from. If these inflows were mainly funded from equities to begin with, mega-caps could have on net received a demand tailwind if the active funds sold to make way for passive had been systematically underweight mega-caps. Given that in aggregate active participants own the market, this is only possible if passive flows were primarily coming from institutional active managers (as opposed to the other big active subset: retail), who are known for being systematically underweight mega-caps to make room for their active bets. 5 If passive flows came primarily from other asset classes (as opposed to being funded from equities), the money flowing into stocks probably went into funds that track investable market cap-weighted indices. An investor buying into such an index fund would purchase the same fraction of each company in the index irrespective of size. 6 This means that the demand shocks these companies experienced were to a first approximation the exact same. The only way for mega-caps to be impacted differentially is if their existing shareholders are consistently less tempted to sell their holdings than the shareholders of large caps. They might be. As we have already noted, institutional active managers are on average underweight mega-caps, especially in markets that are concentrated to begin with. 7 Insofar as a significant portion of these managers has risk limits that cause their underweights to be capped for any single stock - something which could arise directly from (benchmark-relative) position limits, 8 indirectly through tracking-error constraints, or implicitly through a manager's career incentive to not get caught wrongfooted betting against what the marketplace broadly judges to be \"magnificent\" - mega-cap stocks should indeed have lower price elasticity than mere large caps. Since an asset with a smaller pool of willing sellers sees prices rise more to accommodate passive demand, it stands to reason that mega-caps might indeed rise more as a result of passive flows than your average company. That said, we should not fall into the trap of giving excessive weight to subtle arguments. The reality is that subtlety is subtle for a reason; it suggests second-order importance. The stock market's current market cap concentration is mostly a reflection of similar concentration in company profits, not of risk constraints and agency concerns. The impact of price-insensitive dollars coming into equities from cash is of more relevance to the rise in broad valuations than to intra-equity differences. The gap between the performance of mega-caps and everyone else that we cannot explain with fundamentals alone is quite small, and even there passive has not been the sole contributor. Which brings us to subsets of the equity market where passive might actually have played a bigger role. Slaughtering Small, Murdering Value It is natural for passive investing to be touted as an explanation for the long winter of small caps and value stocks. For small companies, it is sufficient to note that the most popular passive funds generally don't contemplate the broad equity market. The smaller you are, the larger the chance of your stock being ignored. The typical argument for value, in turn, rests on the observation that traditional active investors lean toward value companies. If allocators and individuals substituted the portfolios run by these investors for passive indices, a negative demand shock should have taken place for value relative to their growthy peers. 9 The problem would then have been compounded by the underperformance of the factor leading to greater outflows from the active managers who invested in them. The argument for small caps is patently true. For value, it is weaker. Though value-oriented funds have suffered greater outflows than either growth or core funds, it is hard to make the case that these flows were caused by the rise of passive investing. If outflows from these styles were prompted by poor relative performance unrelated to passive to begin with, they would have occurred whether passive funds were available or not. Passive, in this circumstance, would only have mattered insofar as it increased the marginal propensity of investors to sell out of their value and small cap funds. But price elasticities - which we have spoken about for mega-caps - also play a role with value stocks. If a passive fund comes along wanting to buy shares in every publicly listed corporation, its price impact should be lowest among companies whose shareholders are prone to selling in reaction to an increased bid. Value investors are definitionally reactive to increased bids; they are the investors most likely to focus on price targets and on maintaining a margin of safety. In the presence of inelastic (read: price-insensitive) buyers, their thrift might perversely turn from virtue to vice. 10 An indirect appraisal of this effect suggests that it is present. If value investors are more price-sensitive than their growth-oriented competitors, the relative valuations of value vs. growth should have become more volatile with the rise of passive. This in turn means that the value-growth spread should look less volatile in areas of the market that have seen comparatively less interest from passive funds - such as smaller firms. To test this, we form value and growth portfolios within each size quintile of the market. We then measure the relative valuations of value and growth within each size band and the volatility of their spreads over two separate periods: pre-passive (1983-2003) and post-passive (2003-2023). Exhibit 5 confirms that value's relative valuations have grown more volatile within U.S. large caps and less volatile within U.S. small caps. Exhibit 5: Volatility of Valuations - Value vs. Growth As of 5/31/2024 | Source: Compustat, Worldscope, MSCI, Bloomberg, GMO Value's underperformance since 2017 came primarily from unrealistic growth expectations forming for a broad swath of the U.S. stock market. But passive flows clearly did nothing to help matters, especially within large caps. Still, it is not all bad news when it comes to passive and value. Value companies look remarkably cheap today in comparison to the broad U.S. market, and passive has helped make them cheaper . Beyond that, their relative elasticity cuts both ways: while there are more willing sellers of value on the upside, there are equally more willing buyers of value on the downside. As 2022 showed, that is not a feature growth stocks can boast of. Slowing Mean Reversion One of the core tenets of GMO's 7-Year Asset Class Forecasts is that assets with underlying cash flows have a fair value, where fair value is a function of both an asset's expected cash flows and its required rate of return. If the asset is more exposed to systematic risk - doing poorly precisely when asset owners value returns the most - investors will wind up requiring a risk premium (i.e., a higher required rate of return) to hold it. This is why, for one, equities tend to outperform cash and bonds over the long run. If you believe that the risk premium required from different asset classes is roughly constant, then you will observe (as Robert Shiller did) that prices often move far more than, and therefore away from, fair value. Our forecasts contend that they won't do so forever; that asset prices revert, if sometimes slowly. The reasoning is simple: if prices are higher than assets' discounted cash flows, those assets won't be able to deliver on their required rates of return, leading disappointed investors to sell out of them. 11 Conversely, if prices are lower than discounted cash flows, asset returns will surprise on the upside, attracting investor purchases. All of which begs the question of why prices aren't always at fair value to begin with. Focusing on equities, the simplest answer is that investors' cash flow expectations can change a lot . In hindsight, we know that these expectation changes have often, especially in aggregate, been wrong. At the time growth expectations are set, however, they often seem quite reasonable. In 1999 it was hard not to get excited about the prospect of the internet expanding companies' consumer bases; in 2019 it was difficult to question the ability of companies to make services available at almost zero marginal cost through software; today it is easy to see the potential of AI to revolutionize human productivity. Yet we often extrapolate from the high early return on investment of a technology incorrectly; the gains of first adopters of exciting technological advances are often very high (hence the excitement), but the gains of widespread adoption can be quite muted. It pays to remember that in a competitive environment the broad adoption of a cost-reducing technology will generally accrue much more to consumers than it will to shareholders. 12 Exhibit 6 illustrates how the gains from a cost-reducing technology accrue mostly to consumers when competition is present. 13 Exhibit 6: Average Company's Profit Margin Increase from A 50% Cost Reduction Source: GMO In practice, most multi-asset investors are well-aware that price changes led by time-varying cash flow expectations are unlikely to be substantiated ex post. This doesn't mean that they sell out of equities when valuations rise or pile into them when valuations crash. The S&P 500 ( SP500 , SPX ) can trade today at valuations superior to those of 2019 while real interest rates are 2-3 percentage points higher (which might not seem like a lot until you remember that the equity risk premium has averaged about 5% over cash), and most multi-asset portfolios look very similar to what they looked like five years ago. This suggests that the elasticity (read: price sensitivity) of multi-asset investors isn't particularly high. Some of this is due to tight benchmark constraints, some of it is just inertia. This low demand reactivity to prices is the main reason for which reversion to fair value occurs slowly (our typical estimate for equities in different regions has been that they close about 1/7 of their gap to fair value every year). If multi-asset portfolios have been substituted for passive target-date funds, moreover, markets should be even less price-sensitive, and reversion should be more lethargic still than it used to be. Though we are open to this possibility, we have yet to find empirical evidence in its favor. We would expect, for instance, that slower mean reversion would translate to a higher amplitude of valuations because of the slower dissipation of flows-driven price shocks. Exhibit 7, which looks at the range of the U.S. market's total-return-based Shiller P/E over 25-year increments, shows that the recent quarter century has been anomalous only in how reliably high valuations have been. Exhibit 7: Total Return Shiller P/e Range As of 5/31/2024 | Source: Robert Shiller, GMO The absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, especially when we are measuring long-term effects on short time frames. It might still be the case that the rise of passive investing has caused asset-class-level reversion to slow down, particularly in U.S. equities where the presence of passive is most pronounced. If the allocations to passive funds are truly passive - if they don't shift to other asset classes in response to prices or information - then mean reversion is almost guaranteed to have become a slower process. We on the GMO Asset Allocation team stress-test our portfolios by asking whether our positioning would look different under varied circumstances we find plausible, including slower mean reversion in the U.S. (at print time, they would not). We would suggest other valuation-sensitive investors ask similar questions of their own allocations. New and Renewed Opportunities in Active Management We have argued in this letter that the impact of passive investing in markets has been overblown. That said, we do not think it negligible. For one, an increase in inelastic buyers makes for an obvious opportunity in liquidity provision. 14 If an active manager can time when passive flows are likely to meet with illiquidity better than the competition, they can earn a pretty (if not riskless) penny. This is still more profitable if the active manager at hand can estimate the relative elasticity of the extant owners of securities, acting as a liquidity provider where active sellers are scarce. There is of course already an entire (and burgeoning) business around this in markets, much of which comes in the form of index arbitrage. A corollary of flows having a significant impact on valuations is that valuations don't have a significant impact on flows. 15 That is why valuation-sensitive investors - such as GMO's Asset Allocation team - don't bank solely on mean reverting flows in response to dislocated valuations. Investors like us do enjoy allocating to assets when their discounts are particularly large versus history (such as deep value stocks around the world today), but it isn't simply because we expect the deep value discount to snap shut. We like wide valuations because they often suggest that an asset is intrinsically cheap - that it can deliver lovely returns on the back of its cash flows alone. Let's home in on U.S. deep value stocks: companies in the cheapest fifth of the U.S. market. 16 The fundamentals of these companies - their revenues, gross profits, and book value - have historically undergrown those of the broad market by 5% per annum since 1983. Yet the factor has still delivered 3% above the market per annum over the same period. Deep value stocks have managed to compensate for their undergrowth by delivering higher returns from income (i.e., dividends and buybacks) and especially from valuation-led portfolio turnover (which we call \"rebalancing\"). We can see this decomposition of returns in Exhibit 8. Exhibit 8: U.S. Deep Value vs. Rest of Market As of 5/31/2024 | Compustat, Worldscope, MSCI, Bloomberg, GMO The portfolio turnover of deep value occurs on a single-name basis as companies whose bleak prospects improve (a recent example: META ) graduate from the cheapest quintile, and are replaced by companies whose futures strike investors as much less bright than they used to think (a recent example: Zoom Video Communications). Notice that if passive flows are heavily skewed to non-deep value stocks, this doesn't much matter for rebalancing. While this would lead us to expect that the wide deep value spread wouldn't immediately normalize, we would still see cheap companies' growth expectations shift, with those whose expectation shifted upward seeing their individual valuations shoot up as a result. A lovely consequence of value trading at a large discount is that cheap companies see outsized returns when their future gets re-assessed and they exit the deep value quintile (as depicted in Exhibit 9). Exhibit 9: Deep Value Exits' Excess 12 M Return (vs Deep Value, % ) As of 5/31/2024 | Compustat, Worldscope, MSCI, Bloomberg, GMO Exhibit 9 shows the impact of stocks leaving the deep value universe relative to the rest of deep value. The larger the discount the deep value stocks trade at, the larger the excess return of those former deep value companies that leave the group. When deep value has traded at its tightest spread, exits have delivered 10% excess returns versus deep value as a whole. Conversely, when deep value spreads have been at their widest (that's today!), the returns to graduating from the group have been over 25%. Since this effect is mechanical, there is no reason to think it will change with the presence of passive investors. The reality, then, is not so much that the rise of passive investing ruins markets, but only that it changes them. It changes how much short-term investors should care about flows. It potentially changes how much long-term investors should bank on mean reversion. It changes how all investors should think about correlations, seeing as both passive flows and passive allocations might mechanically introduce (or reinforce) sources of asset co-movement. 17 Our responsibility as an active manager is to notice these changes, think of what obstacles and opportunities they create, and make money from them. Conclusion As we admitted at the start of this piece, it's hard to prove the impacts of passive investing on the market with a high degree of certainty. But we were able to use what we know about how the stock market works and how different investors operate to make some claims about plausible effects that passive may have had and what we can expect going forward. It is important to keep in mind that whatever effects the rise of passive investing has had, it doesn't change the way that stock investors make money in the long term. The primary drivers of long-term returns in the stock market are the future cash flows of the underlying companies and the prices that investors pay for those cash flows. Passive investing should not meaningfully change those cash flows, barring the conspiracy theories about corporate managers choosing not to compete with each other due to common ownership of the companies. 18 If passive investing does have some lasting impact on prices, those prices impact the timing of returns, not their ultimate level. If the price of the mega-caps was artificially pushed up by passive flows, then those stocks are overvalued and their future returns will be sub-par. If the higher price-sensitivity of the holders of value stocks has led to them trading at too wide a discount to the market as money has moved to passive vehicles, value stocks will outperform in the future. Passive has unquestionably changed the landscape of investing. But it hasn't changed the math of investing, and at the end of the day it is the math that matters most. Footnotes 1 At least in terms of aggregate difficulty for those involved in writing it. Ben certainly has had quarterlies which took more personal blood, sweat, and toil, given that John put in the bulk of the toil and no small amount of the blood and sweat. But if we add up the blood, sweat, and toil across the two of us, it's been a pretty bloody, sweaty effort indeed. 2 If you did not catch the reference in Exhibit 1, you have the correct amount of regard for social media. It refers to the extraordinary reaction of GameStop stock prices to a tweet by GameStop retail evangelist, @TheRoaringKitty, containing nothing but this image. 3 We don't want to come off sounding excessively cynical on this. While passively managed target date funds are not necessarily the ideal retirement investment for employees, they are very far from the worst thing one could think of. There is plenty of evidence that putting participants into these default options and indeed automatically enrolling them into plans in the first place leads to better outcomes than leaving employees to their own devices. But having sat on the investment committees of endowments, foundations, and defined contribution pension plans, we can attest that the overarching goal of the first two is the pursuit of investment excellence and that of the last is the building of a paper trail that demonstrates the committee did not do anything they could be sued over. 4 The marginal change in demand for the stock as its price rises incrementally. A stock with low price elasticity sees relatively low interest in selling it as its price increases. 5 A topic we spoke about at length in our last Quarterly Letter, Magnificently Concentrated: Your Active Managers Are More Competent Than They Look (Inker and Pease, 2024). 6 Well, kind of. The ability to short does make free float an imperfect measure of the available supply of individual stocks. For most companies, and in particular for mega-caps, short interest rarely exceeds 10%. 7 See footnote 5. 8 A large active bet on a single stock puts a portfolio in the awkward position of taking large idiosyncratic bets against its benchmark. 9 The smallest cohorts in the market, which are largely ignored by most passive funds, should have suffered most. 10 If value investors were purely focused on valuation ranks , there is little reason for this effect to be strong. We would argue a non-trivial portion of value investors is focused on absolute valuations - dipping more into the deep value cohort as broad valuations rise - and that this introduces higher elasticity for cheap stocks. 11 They can, of course, deliver on those returns by seeing prices rise further away from fair value. But unless market participants are willing to engage in an everlasting game of hot potato, with prices moving infinitely far from fair value, this is bound to lead to ever-more-disappointing returns. 12 It would be reasonable to push back on this by saying that the market landscape in the U.S. today is much less competitive than it was in the past, and that therefore the broad adoption of a new technology (e.g., AI) might help push up profit margins by more than it would have in the past. This does assume that a broad decline in costs wouldn't have a positive effect on competition going forward, however. 13 We set up a Cournot model with a linear demand function and a linear cost function. 14 While the opportunity is obvious, exploiting that opportunity profitably is significantly less so. 15 If a stock gets new attention from some investors and this increases its price, then it must be true that insufficient existing shareholders were willing to part with the stock at lower prices. 16 To try to take advantage of the much larger than normal discounts for these deep value stocks in the U.S. and non-U.S. markets, GMO launched the U.S. Opportunistic Value Strategy and the International Opportunistic Value Strategy in 2022 and 2023, respectively. 17 The flows argument is direct: one dollar invested in (or divested from) the S&P 500 will necessarily impact all stocks within the index simultaneously. Any two stocks will therefore be more correlated, controlling for all of their characteristics, if they belong to the same index and said index is receiving (or losing) flows. More intriguing, however, is the possibility that passive funds can change asset correlations even in the absence of new flows. The mere heft of target date funds as a fraction of the multi-asset landscape, for instance, should lead bonds and equities to be more positively correlated, given target date funds' mandate of keeping a pre-defined equity/bond split. If equity prices rally because of blowout Nvidia earnings, all target date funds need to sell out of equities and rebalance into bonds. Understanding these correlation shifts before they happen can at the very least help active investors build portfolios that are more resilient to unanticipated shocks, and ideally can serve to shape actual investment strategies. 18 One can picture a hilarious and incisive Matt Levine piece on the topic when it turns out that the proposed cage match between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk was in fact a smokescreen to hide the fact that the CEOs of the world's largest companies had built a giant Telegram group chat and made a pact to avoid competing with each other at the behest of Larry Fink.

The finished down 2.51% for its worst weekly performance since October. The and slipped 1.66% and 2.20%, respectively, for the week. The slump comes ahead of key readings on corporate earnings and the economy. Earnings reports from Home Depot and Lowe's on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, will give investors a better sense of how U.S. consumers are faring. Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday evening could be even more impactful, as the artificial intelligence-linked chipmaker is still one of the biggest stocks by market cap. This will be Nvidia's first earnings report since the emergence of the DeepSeek large language model from China that cast doubt on the sustainability of the AI trade. \"It's definitely one of the top things that the markets will be looking at [this] week. They really want to see whether the DeepSeek news ... is solid in terms of disrupting these types of companies' margins in the future,\" said Lale Akoner, global market analyst at eToro. Then Friday will deliver the January reading of the personal consumption expenditures index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. The slide for stocks last week came amid renewed concerns about economic growth in the U.S. However, the market indexes are all still within 4% of their record highs.

    "title": "US federal court extends block on Biden’s student debt relief plan totalling half a trillion dollars",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, Aug 10 — A federal appeals court on Friday extended an order blocking President Joe Biden's administration from further implementing a student debt relief plan designed to lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers and speed up loan forgiveness for some. The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely granted an injunction pending an appeal requested by seven Republican-led states of a lower-court order that they said did not go far enough in blocking the U.S. Department of Education's debt relief plan. U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the Biden administration strongly disagreed with the court's decision. \"If allowed to stand, this ruling would force millions of borrowers to pay hundreds of dollars more each month,\" Cardona said. The court previously at the urging of those states had on July 18 issued an order that temporarily blocked the administration from implementing parts of Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan that a Missouri judge had not already enjoined. The court's Friday order was prospective, as the three-judge panel said the Republican-led states \"cannot turn back the clock on any loans that have already been forgiven.\" The three judges – Raymond Gruender, Ralph Erickson and L. Steven Grasz – were all appointed by Republican presidents. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, hailed the ruling in a social media post. Missouri was the lead plaintiff in the case. \"The Eighth Circuit has upheld the court order we obtained to BLOCK the illegal Biden/Harris half-a-TRILLION dollar student loan cancellation scheme,\" Bailey said. \"A massive win for every American who won’t be saddled with someone else’s Ivy League debt.\" The Republican-led states argued in their lawsuit filed in April that the Biden administration's U.S. Education Department had exceeded its legal authority by enacting the student debt relief plan. The administration's plan provides more generous terms than past income-based repayment plans, lowering monthly payments for eligible borrowers and allowing those whose original principal balances were US$12,000 or less to have their debt forgiven after 10 years. The administration had opposed the states' request, saying they wanted an \"extraordinary\" injunction that would increase the monthly payments for millions of borrowers and stop any forgiveness even under regulations they had not challenged at the trial court level. U.S. District Judge John Ross in St. Louis had in June blocked the administration from continuing to provide debt forgiveness for some smaller loans in as few as 10 years, compared to the 20- or 25-year timeline earlier rules provided. Litigation over the SAVE Plan followed earlier court challenges by Republican-led states to a broader, US$430 billion program championed by Biden, a Democrat, that would have fulfilled a campaign promise by cancelling up to US$20,000 in debt for up to 43 million Americans. That plan was ultimately blocked by the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023. The SAVE Plan was slated to fully take effect on July 1, though parts of it have already been implemented. The White House has said that over 20 million borrowers could benefit from the SAVE Plan. The Education Department says that 8 million are already enrolled, including 4.5 million whose monthly payments have been reduced to US$0. The Education Department on Thursday said it had already granted US$5.5 billion to 414,000 borrowers through the SAVE Plan. The administration estimated that the plan would cost taxpayers around US$156 billion over 10 years, but Republican state attorneys general argue that its actual cost totaled around US$475 billion. Another federal judge in Kansas had also blocked parts of the SAVE Plan, though a different federal appeals court, the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, put part of that decision on hold. A group of Republican-led states have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate that injunction. — Reuters",

While a weak consumer and automotive production backdrop impacted organic revenue, we capitalized on relative bright spots and delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of DEWALT growth as well as higher sales in aerospace fasteners. \"We remain focused on executing against areas primarily within our control: our supply chain transformation and accelerating share gain. This transformation continues to reshape our cost structure and fund new growth investments, which together are expected to further strengthen our powerful brands, accelerate innovation and enhance our in-market activation to capture the compelling long-term opportunities in our industry. \" Stanley Black & Decker is built on the strength of our people and culture, with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions. With the execution of our strategy, we are positioning the Company to deliver higher levels of organic revenue growth*, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns.\" The Company's primary areas of multi-year strategic focus remain unchanged: Advancing innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic revenue growth* of 2 to 3 times the market Streamlining and simplifying the organization, and investing in initiatives that more directly impact our customers and end users Returning adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels by accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to improve fill rates and better match inventory with customer demand Prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization 3 Q'24 Key Points: Net sales for the quarter were $3.8 billion , down 5% versus prior year as price (+1%) was offset by volume (-3%), currency (-1%), and the previously announced Infrastructure business divestiture (-2%). Gross margin for the quarter was 29.9%, up 310 basis points versus the prior year rate of 26.8%. Adjusted gross margin* was 30.5%, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to the supply chain transformation. SG&A expenses were 21.2% of sales for the quarter versus 20.1% in the prior year. Excluding charges, adjusted SG&A expenses* were 20.8% of sales, up versus 19.3% in the prior year, as the Company increased growth investments designed to deliver future market share gains. Net earnings from continuing operations was 2.4% of sales versus 0.1% of sales in the prior year. Third quarter EBITDA* was 8.6% of sales versus 4.8% of sales in the prior year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA* was 10.8% of sales, up 140 basis points versus prior year. Third quarter cash from operating activities was $286 million . Free cash flow* in the third quarter was approximately $200 million , which contributed to approximately $100 million of debt reduction in the third quarter. 3Q'24 Segment Results Tools & Outdoor net sales were down 3% versus third quarter 2023, driven by volume (-3%) and currency (-1%), partially offset by price (+1%). Organic revenue was down 2%, as growth in DEWALT was offset by the weak consumer and DIY backdrop. Regional organic revenues* were: North America (-4%), Europe (+1%) and rest of world (+6%). The Tools & Outdoor segment margin was 10.0%, up 190 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted segment margin* was 11.1%, up 180 basis points versus third quarter 2023, primarily due to supply chain transformation benefits, which were partially offset by growth investments. Industrial net sales were down 18% versus third quarter 2023, driven by the Infrastructure business divestiture (-17%) and volume (-2%), partially offset by price (+1%). Engineered Fastening organic revenues* were down 1%, as aerospace expansion and a return to growth in general industrial was more than offset by market softness in automotive. The Industrial segment margin was 14.4%, up 400 basis points versus prior year 10.4%. The adjusted segment margin* was 13.9%, up 170 basis points versus third quarter 2023 due to price realization and cost control. Global Cost Reduction Program Supporting Gross Margin Expansion The Company continued executing a series of initiatives that are expected to generate $1.5 billion of pre-tax run-rate cost savings by the end of 2024, growing to $2 billion by the end of 2025. Of the $2 billion savings, $1.5 billion is expected to be delivered through a supply chain transformation that leverages strategic sourcing, drives operational excellence, consolidates facilities and optimizes the distribution network, and reduces complexity of the product portfolio. These actions are expected to return adjusted gross margins* to historical 35%+ levels. Additionally, the Global Cost Reduction Program is expected to optimize the Company's cost base to fund investments that accelerate growth in core businesses. The Global Cost Reduction Program generated $105 million of incremental pre-tax run-rate cost savings in third quarter 2024. Since inception of the program in mid-2022, the Company has generated approximately $1.4 billion in pre-tax run-rate savings and reduced inventory by over $2 billion . 2024 Outlook Patrick D. Hallinan , Executive Vice President and CFO, commented, \"Our gross margin meaningfully expanded in the third quarter versus both the prior year quarter and the first half of 2024, driven by the disciplined execution of our supply chain transformation, and we remain on track to achieve an approximately 30% adjusted gross margin* for the full year. Our ability to deliver approximately $200 million of free cash flow* year-to-date supported our capital allocation priorities, including our dividend and debt reduction, along with reinvestment in growth initiatives. Looking forward, we remain focused on executing further supply chain improvements to drive toward our target of 35%+ adjusted gross margins,* support incremental growth investments and deliver improved earnings. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, cash generation and balance sheet strength to position the Company for long-term growth and value creation.\" Management is narrowing its 2024 EPS guidance ranges with GAAP EPS to be between $1.15 to $1.75 (from $0.90 to $2.00 ) and adjusted EPS* to be between $3.90 to $4.30 (from $3.70 to $4.50 ). Free cash flow* is reiterated at approximately $650 million to $850 million . The difference between 2024 GAAP and adjusted EPS* guidance is approximately $2.55 to $2.75 , consisting primarily of charges related to the supply chain transformation under the Global Cost Reduction Program, environmental reserve adjustments and a brand impairment charge. Non-GAAP Adjustments Total pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments in the third quarter of 2024 were $105.9 million , primarily related to non-cash impairment charges, footprint actions and other costs related to the supply chain transformation, and restructuring costs. Gross profit included $24.8 million of charges, while SG&A included $15.1 million . Other, net included a net benefit of $3.0 million , and Restructuring included $22.1 million of charges. In addition, the Company recognized $46.9 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in the third quarter of 2024.

Investor Contacts: Dennis Lange Vice President, Investor Relations [email protected] (860) 827-3833 Christina Francis Director, Investor Relations [email protected] (860) 438-3470 Media Contacts: Debora Raymond Vice President, Public Relations [email protected] (203) 640-8054 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth, organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit, gross margin, SG&A, segment profit, segment margin, earnings, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges, such as environmental charges, supply chain transformation costs, acquisition and divestiture-related items, asset impairments, restructuring, and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS, is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 16 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors . The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results, business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods. The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS, presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges, as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to forecasted GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations, a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

    "title": "7 tips to prepare for next year’s taxes now",
    "text": "By Kemberley Washington, CPA, Bankrate.com (TNS) As the end of the year approaches, now’s the time to start preparing for filing your 2024 tax return in 2025. When it comes to tax strategies, generally Dec. 31 is the deadline to make changes that might lower your tax bill. One major exception is the deadline for contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA : You have until April 15, 2025, to make a contribution to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax year 2024. If you qualify for deductible IRA contributions , then a contribution to your traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income for 2024. Here are tips and strategies to prepare now for the 2025 tax-filing deadline. If you had significant changes in your life in 2024 — maybe you got married or divorced, started your own business, or had to claim unemployment benefits — your taxes may be more complicated. As a result, you might need to hire a certified public accountant (CPA), enrolled agent (EA) or other tax professional to prepare and file your taxes. If you decide to hire someone, it’s best to start planning for that sooner rather than later. Waiting until the calendar flips to April could cost you. The average fee for a professional to prepare and file a simple Form 1040 tax return, with no itemized deductions, is about $220, according to a survey by the National Society of Accountants in 2020-2021, the most recent data available. But that amount rises quickly for more complex returns, and varies depending on where you live. For example, a Form 1040 with itemized deductions costs an average of $432 in states on the Pacific Coast, compared with $285 in New England. No matter where you live, prices usually rise as the tax deadline approaches, so it’s smart to start searching for a tax pro soon. If you’re uncomfortable doing your taxes on your own and can’t afford a CPA, enrolled agent or other tax pro, or to pay for tax software , there are free options to consider. The IRS currently offers three ways to prepare your taxes for free: •With the IRS Free File program, the IRS partners with for-profit tax-software companies that offer free tax-prep software to eligible taxpayers so they can file their federal tax returns for free. Some taxpayers may also qualify for a free state tax filing, depending on the software provider. In January, the IRS will announce the income limit to qualify for the program for the 2025 tax season (for filing 2024 tax returns). For the 2024 tax season (2023 tax returns), taxpayers’ adjusted gross income (AGI) couldn’t exceed $79,000. •The IRS also offers its Direct File program, a free tool that allows you to file your federal income tax return directly with the IRS at no cost. The program supports simple tax returns and is available only in certain states. Check to see if you qualify here. •Another free-filing option is the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. IRS-certified volunteers offer free basic tax preparation in person to people who earn less than $67,000 a year, are disabled or whose English is limited. The IRS has an online location tool for hundreds of free tax preparation sites in the U.S. (the locator tool is updated from February through April). Some VITA sites also offer online tax-prep assistance. Now is a good time to create an IRS online account. If you want to see your Form 1040 from last year, or you’re missing a prior year Form W-2 or mortgage interest statement, you can find your documents using this free tax tool. Another benefit of creating an IRS online account is that it allows you to quickly obtain your prior year’s tax information without sitting on the phone for hours with an IRS representative, says Carl Johnson, a certified public accountant in New Orleans. An IRS online account also lets you view your account balance and payment history for each year. You can also create a payment plan to settle your federal income tax debt within minutes. If you’re 73 years old and have enjoyed watching your 401(k) or IRA grow tax-free without touching it, remember that the IRS is going to want its share each year. That means you’ll have to make withdrawals — and pay income tax. If you turned 73 in 2024, plan to take your required minimum distribution (RMD) at the latest by April 1, 2025. Read this IRS bulletin for more information. The amount of your RMDs is based on your age and the year-end values of your retirement accounts. A Roth IRA has two big tax advantages over a traditional IRA : Qualified withdrawals are not considered income for federal (and usually state) tax purposes, and you don’t have to take distributions from a Roth every year once you reach age 73. Converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may save you money in the long run. Just know that when you convert an IRA to a Roth, it’s considered taxable income, which will raise your tax bill for that year. Generally, it’s best to convert to a Roth IRA when you’re in a low-income year. As tax season approaches, many people start receiving phone calls, emails and texts from entities claiming to be the IRS. Be wary, and understand that these are scams. Typically, the IRS will mail you a notice before using any other method of communication to notify you concerning issues with your tax return. The IRS won’t reach out via social media or text messaging. Relatedly, the IRS warns taxpayers to be careful when choosing a tax preparer. Taking time to vet your tax preparer is crucial to protect yourself from tax scams and fraud. Before hiring a tax professional, search that person’s name in the IRS database of federal tax return preparers to avoid dishonest “professionals.” “Taxpayers should check the tax professional’s credentials,” Johnson says. Tax pros without credentials “may take questionable positions without any degree of scrutiny or fear of losing their access to the profession,” Johnson says. Taxpayers who don’t file a tax return and owe a tax bill, or who file but don’t pay their tax bill on time, risk severe penalties. The IRS can even seize assets if necessary. Respond quickly if the IRS has been sending you letters because it found an error on your return or claims you owe back taxes. Typically, the IRS will send you a notice if you have a balance due, changes were made to your tax return, or the agency needs additional information. “If you ignore a collection letter from the IRS, you may face wage garnishments, liens, bank levies, and other adverse action. And in some cases, the amount due may increase for failure to respond,” Johnson says. Keep in mind the IRS does offer installment plans and other payment plans. Make copies of your correspondence and use only the U.S. Postal Service, the postmark from which is your proof of timeliness when responding. But whatever you do, don’t ignore the IRS because this may cause more issues in the future. ©2024 Bankrate.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Mario Draghi wants the EU to build global corporate champions like Airbus. Good luck on that",
    "text": "Former Italian prime minister and economist Mario Draghi delivers a speech during a plenary session of the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, eastern France, on Sept. 17. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images In Europe, Airbus is a cherished corporate star, as it should be. When its predecessor company was launched in the 1970s, Europeans thought the passenger-jet venture was borderline insane, doomed to prove that Europe could never compete with the Americans in the aerospace market. At the time, Boeing BA-N had been in the game for more than half a century and Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas were pumping out planes, too. A fourth player? Forget it. It was a long burn for Airbus but perseverance paid off, big time – today, it is the global leader in commercial aviation. Since 2019, it has outpaced Boeing (Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas are long gone) in aircraft orders and deliveries. Its market value, at €106-billion ($160-billion), is a quarter greater than Boeing’s. Airbus is expanding and has assembly plants in Quebec and Alabama. Boeing, meanwhile, stumbles from crisis to crisis. The flip-side of the story is that Airbus is the global success story that proves to be the exception. The European Union doesn’t do global success stories nearly as well or as often as the Americans. The EU competitiveness report launched earlier this month by Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, says as much. In essence, he concludes that the EU, and its fulsome social-services model, could fail unless it smartens up and faces what he calls its “existential challenge.” Take this sobering paragraph: “Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, there is no EU company with a market capitalization of over €100-billion that has been set up from scratch in the last 50 years, while all six U.S. companies with a valuation above €1-trillion have been created in this period.” Not one of the top-10 tech companies, measured by market value, is European. Semi-conductor giant ASML ASMLF of the Netherlands, in 12th position, is the closest contender, yet its value is one-tenth of Apple’s AAPL-Q . To be sure, the EU produced some global success stories decades ago that spend fortunes on research and development, but they tend to be concentrated in the auto sector (Volkswagen VWAGY , Mercedes MBGAF , BMW BMWYY ) and those companies are not creating jobs any more. Their market values are relatively small, they are far more likely to close factories in the next decade than open them, and China has taken the lead in the electric-vehicle revolution. The German automakers risk becoming relics of the past. So what did Airbus do to soar to the top? The business marked a rare collaboration between European governments, mostly from Germany, France and Spain, to combine their aerospace interests into one company, make sure it was well financed and run by pushy executives with a clearly defined goal, that is, create a rival to Boeing. It worked. Airbus is an example of sustained and ambitious pan-European teamwork that overcame parochial national interests. That experiment is unlikely to be repeated in spite of Mr. Draghi’s urgings. His 400-page report called for common bonds to help finance investments worth €800-billion a year, the integration of capital markets, common energy infrastructure and the dilution of competition rules to allow certain strategic sectors, such as telecoms and defence, to consolidate and create transnational powerhouses. The chances of all this happening, or at least happening fast enough not to get buried by the Americans and the Chinese, is remote. The EU is not a single entity like America or China. Its 27 countries are rarely unified on any domestic, foreign, industrial or environmental issue. Hungary, which is pro-Russia and continues to import Russian gas, comes to mind; it is the big hole in the EU’s pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia stance. The common market is not as common as advertised – the regulations and bureaucratic hassles that companies must endure to expand their businesses across borders can be numbing. The debt-fearing Germans and Dutch oppose the sale of common bonds to finance grandiose projects, or any projects, beyond the €200-billion devoted to the pandemic recovery funds. If common bonds never materialize, EU-wide investment funding would have to come from the EU budget, which is wholly inadequate to help build the bloc as a competitive force in any field. The budget is worth only about 1 per cent of the EU’s economic output. What else? How about energy prices. The United States is an oil and natural gas powerhouse and energy-intensive industries thrive on cheap prices. The EU has mostly stopped importing cheap Russian oil and gas and has little domestic hydrocarbon production. Germany, incredibly, recently closed all its nuclear power stations. Add this all up and poor Mr. Draghi is dreaming if he thinks his competitive action plan will be taken seriously and actually implemented. It should be, of course, but the EU remains a collection of countries without a common vision. Another Airbus seems like an impossibility.",

    "title": "What financial experts wish you knew about divorce",
    "text": "Divorce is a major financial reset, yet also one of the worst times to make a lot of important decisions. There are emotions, for sure, said Lena Keshysheva, founder of B.C.-based Sapling Financial Planning & Wellness. But there’s also sheer volume and exhaustion. “While I encourage people to start thinking about the financial planning aspect of things, I also encourage people to wait on purchasing their life insurance policies, or to wait to change their investment advisers, or wait to purchase the new home until there’s clarity,” she said. Those going through divorce eventually suffer from \"decision-making burnout,\" she added. Assemble a support network, including legal and financial expertise, and then go slow from there, Keshysheva said. Some decisions can be delayed or spaced out. The only critical error to avoid is trying to do it without legal help. “People tend to try to save money and not have the legal advice,” Keshysheva said. “That’s a bad idea. Legal guidance is non-negotiable.” There is often a learning curve on finances for one or both spouses, said Colin White, CEO of Verecan Capital Management in Halifax. It’s rare for both people in a marriage to have an equal hand in every aspect, he said. “Everybody’s going to have to learn things that they maybe weren’t paying attention to, right?” White said. “And it could go either way -- either member of the family could have taken over the dominant role and part of the finances that somebody else has to learn.” Keshysheva noted it’s fairly common for one person to manage the household budget, while the other manages investments and long-term planning. This can create a sense of betrayal in the divorce if assets or debts were misrepresented, or accounts were emptied — “financial infidelity,” she explained. Keshysheva finds sometimes people are willing to let go of some money issues. However, one aspect of divorce that is almost always contentious is the kids. Divorce cases with custody battles are usually most expensive, she said. “When it comes to your children, I think it’s more understandable that this is something harder to let go,” she said. In terms of the emotional turmoil of a relationship breakdown, don’t bring that into the legal proceedings, White said — both sides lose. “People going through divorce, it tends to be super emotional and there can be an urge to try to punish somebody, go through the process and punish them financially and make things difficult,” White said. “That just backfires — always. A contentious divorce is going to cost a lot more legal fees, and very seldom, if ever, leads to a better outcome.\" In other words: a therapist is cheaper than a lawyer. “If you try to punish somebody during the process, lawyers are going to win,” he added. \"Lawyers are going to be the ones that take all that money.” The biggest mistake White sees in divorce cases, however, is not severing all financial ties when the marriage breaks up. Ex-couples might think it’s simpler to finish paying off a car together rather than refinancing, or manage the kids’ Registered Education Savings Plans jointly. But even in a relatively amicable split, White says this is a bad idea. “We’ve run into situations where there’s a divorced couple and they have an RESP for their kids,” he said. “That means that there’s joint decision making going on. There’s disclosure of financial situations on account documentation. There’s all kinds of complications that come with that.” If one or both of the partners remarry, the dynamic often changes, and there can be new animosity in the relationship. One ex-partner may fall on hard times and stop making car payments, which can impair the shared asset, White said. “You’re setting yourself up to be financially attached to somebody you’ve chosen not to be married to,” he said. “You both try to move on with your lives, and you still have this tie. If things become less amicable, or remarriage happens, circumstances change, somebody gets sick, somebody loses a job — if you’re financially tied to somebody, then that becomes your problem.” Another common mistake? Consulting social media for advice, Keshysheva said. It’s normal to reach out to social networks during an emotional and isolating time, she pointed out, but it’s dangerous to get financial advice from others, as everybody’s situation will be different. “Often, the use of social media can be a powerful tool, but it’s so important to treat it carefully,” Keshysheva said. Financial advice from social media users can be clouded by their own opinions, biases and personal experience, so \"what that effectively does is it adds a lot more confusion, making an already stressful situation even more stressful.” Social media posts have also been used in divorce cases to prove behaviour or document assets, according to media reports. It’s better to keep your social media clean and hire professionals to handle your legal and financial situation, Keshysheva said. “We’re humans, we have a need to connect,” she said. “But don’t overuse it for advice, and don’t overshare.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 10, 2024.

    "title": "Smurfit Westrock Plc (SMFKY) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript",
    "text": "Smurfit Westrock Plc ( OTCPK:SMFKY ) Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call July 30, 2024 5:00 PM ET Company Participants Ciaran Potts - Head of IR Tony Smurfit - CEO Ken Bowles - CFO Conference Call Participants Charlie Muir-Sands - BNP Paribas Exane Justin Jordan - Davy George Staphos - Bank of America Securities Lars Kjellberg - Stifel Philip Ng - Jefferies Gabe Hajde - Wells Fargo Gaurav Jain - Barclays Operator Welcome to Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results for Smurfit Westrock Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Ciaran Potts, Head of Investor Relations at Smurfit Westrock. Please go ahead. Ciaran Potts Thank you, Alan.

Given time constraints and demand, I would ask that you keep the two questions and hold detailed modeling questions. I will now hand over to Tony Smurfit, CEO of Smurfit Westrock. Tony Smurfit Thank you, Ciaran, and good evening, everyone. I am delighted to be with you this evening and I thank you for taking the time to listen to this call, which is held together with Ken Bowles, our CFO. July 5th was a truly momentous day for our company and our stakeholders when we concluded the combination of Smurfit Kappa and Westrock and then on July 8, when we commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange with our primary listing, Smurfit Westrock. And in doing so, we became the largest listed packaging company in the world. Interestingly, you'll see from this slide a picture of a gigantic corrugated bull, which attracted worldwide attention from everyone who saw it and posted it online. Not only is corrugated packaging highly interesting, creative and innovative, it is of course recyclable, renewable and biodegradable. The vision of our company is to be a globally admired business, dynamically and sustainably delivering secure and superior returns for all stakeholders. I think, over the years, we have shown that we are well on our way to realizing this vision. As part of that journey, we've taken certain steps over many years. These include continuous investments, selective acquisitions, development of innovation and service for our customers and the extensive training and development of our people. Along the way, we have had many defining moments, including the merger with Kappa Packaging in 2005, its subsequent IPO in 2007, navigating the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the successful defense of the unsolicited approach by International Paper, and of course, the defining moment not only for our company, but also for the industry by combining with Westrock all the while, while delivering outstanding operational and financial performance. The combination gives Smurfit Westrock the opportunity to give our customers world-class packaging solutions across four continents and 40 countries with unrivaled innovation and a unique footprint for our customers. Our combination to form Smurfit Westrock will be run by a management team that has a proven track record and has consistently delivered superior performance. Moreover, it is also a management team that has a track record of identifying, acquiring and optimizing the performance of undervalued assets. In that context, it is important to note that the transaction was concluded at an optimal time, whereby both sets of stakeholders will benefit from and participate in the go-to sustainable packaging company in our industry. I would like to briefly recap on the factors that have sustained Smurfit Kappa success. While you've often heard me say that success is never a straight line, what you will see here is a structural growth story. This slide also shows the continuing benefits of our medium-term capital plan. Since 2015, we invested some $6 billion to optimize our integrated operating model. We also acquired complementary businesses with an aggregate value of $2 billion. Outperformance has generated substantial free cash flow while delivering a progressive income stream for our shareholders. Those capital allocation decisions, together with ongoing operating excellence, have over the last eight years to the end of 2023 delivered 100% increase in EBITDA, a 470 basis-point increase in EBITDA margin and a 520 basis-point increase in ROCE, all the while building balance sheet strength and sustaining a highly-attractive income stream. This performance has continued where we have again delivered a strong set of results against the backdrop of higher recovered fiber costs and lower corrugated costs, which are now being recovered. Ken will take you through these results in greater detail in a few minutes. For those of you that don't know the company, we've been able to deliver consistently through a fundamental element of our business and that is our people and our culture. The only true differentiating factor in any company is culture. And we and Smurfit Kappa have fostered a winning owner-operator culture and adherence to our core values of loyalty, integrity, respect and safety at work. Along the way, we have provided our customers with more and more sophisticated and innovative packaging to meet the various demands of sustainability, innovation and merchandising. Through performance, we have transferred the perception of our product away from being merely a transport medium towards being seen by customers as a vital value-added product in their supply chain. This came into sharp focus during COVID when corrugated was deemed as essential and critical to the supply chain. And while the past is no guarantee of future success, it is, however, a good guide. The Smurfit and Westrock combination marries up extremely well. We have more product ranges in sustainable packaging. We're more integrated, we have significant synergy potential and we have a unique global footprint. Our significant project range is diverse with high-margin product areas and we occupy number-one or number-two positions in most of the countries and markets in which we operate. The uniqueness of Smurfit Westrock cannot be underestimated and the coming together of the two organizations brings incredible expertise to be harnessed with far broader opportunities for every stakeholder. Clearly, the question is what is next for the combination. We intend to follow the model that has been successful for Smurfit Kappa across our world and operations. As I said before, the next phase of our journey will take time as we focus on the execution of putting these two excellent companies together as we develop a cohesive performance-led culture within the new Smurfit Westrock and as we focus on putting our customers at the heart of everything that we do. What I have seen so far within the legacy Westrock business is impressive. To date, together with my colleagues, we have seen in excess of over 100 operating units and met with thousands of energized and excited employees, providing an excellent foundation from which to build. I'm also encouraged by the energy, enthusiasm and resolve across the organization to realize the success that the combination will present for all stakeholders. Now, I'll pass it over to Ken to take you through some of the financials. Ken Bowles Thank you, Tony, and good evening, everyone. Turning now to Slide 10 and Smurfit Kappa Group's second-quarter 2024 results, which are reported in U.S. dollars and prepared under U.S. GAAP. As outlined in the release, due to the timing of the completion of the combination of Smurfit Kappa and Westrock, the GAAP results for the combined company of Smurfit Westrock will be reported from the third quarter of 2024. These results, another strong set, should be seen in the right context which is against the backdrop of higher input costs, particularly OCC, but also before the expected recovery of those input costs through box price increases. As you can see, not only by the EBITDA outcome but also the margin of 16.2%, we are in excellent shape as we enter the second half of the year. And now just some more detail on those numbers. In the second quarter, net sales were approximately $3 billion or 3% lower compared to the same period last year, with the decrease primarily driven by lower average box pricing in our European business year-on-year. However, this was partially offset by an increase in group targeted volumes of 3.1%, a $28 million net positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations, and a $4 million positive impact from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA of the group was $480 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $556 million and a margin of 18.1% in the second quarter of 2023. In Europe, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $77 million year-on-year, $355 million in the second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a $143 million reduction in net sales and increased costs for labor, distribution and recovered fiber. However, these cost headwinds were partially offset by a decrease in energy and other raw material costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin in Europe was 16.1% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 18.4% in the same quarter of the prior year. Conversely, our Americas business saw an increased adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year of $6 million, reaching $146 million in the second quarter of 2024. This increase was mostly due to a $36 million rise in net sales, partially offset by higher costs for raw materials and labor. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the Americas was 19.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 19.3% in the same period of the previous year. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $33 million, $340 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in tax payments and a positive change in working capital and net cash interest, partially offset by a reduction in consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items. Including capital expenditure of $177 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $224 million in the same period last year and excluding transaction costs paid associated with the Smurfit Westrock combination amounted to $23 million, adjusted free cash flow was $186 million in the second quarter, up from $83 million in the same period of last year. Net debt was $3.1 billion at the end of June, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 1.6 times compared to 1.3 times at the end of December 2023 and well within the stated leverage range of 1.5 times to 2 times for legacy Smurfit Kappa. And finally, on July 26th, Smurfit Westrock's Board declared a quarterly dividend of $30.25 per share payable in September. While not part of these results we are reporting today, we felt it might be useful, particularly for comparative purposes to illustrate on a very simplistic basis legacy Smurfit Kappa and Legacy Westrock for the first six months of the year. I don't propose to dwell on the numbers, but based on the numbers here, the legacy Westrock business delivered on a Smurfit Westrock adjusted EBITDA basis $669 million for the quarter to June. Further detail on the calculation and reconciliation can be found in the appendix to this presentation. When we announced the conversation back in September, we had aligned a synergy number of $400 million to be achieved by the end of 2025. Now that we are one organization, the detailed work in relation to those synergies has begun with teams validating that number. The teams are also beginning to scope out other areas of synergy and value creation or indeed dive deeper on initial areas such as Mexico to explore further opportunities. We will update you more formally later on this year around synergies, but for now, we feel ever more comfortable about the initial estimate and excited about new areas of opportunity. And looking now at Slide 13 on capital allocation. For anyone who is new to the Smurfit Kappa side of the story, our capital allocation framework is well-established. Returns focus at its core, both flexible and agile, it has been and will continue to be a key underpin to our success. From Tony's earlier slides, you can see the evidence of that. That framework will now be the basis of the capital allocation at Smurfit Westrock, that's probably not a surprise. At Smurfit Westrock, we believe that capital allocation to internal projects will be central to our future success. Today, more than ever before, we are seeing the benefits of having well-invested asset bases with integrated mill systems and box plants sitting along the cost curve and primed for future growth. Well-timed and well-executed capital expenditure programs were a hallmark of SKG and we are bringing the experience and tenure of the senior management team who executed those programs to Smurfit Westrock. The dividend is another cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. As a reminder, Smurfit Westrock intends to pay a dividend in line with the progressive dividend policy of SKG. And as we seek to harmonize the different dividend streams and payment cycles for the remainder of 2024, as noted before, we are paying a dividend for this quarter of $30.25. As we begin the first full year of Westrock in 2025, we expect the base for that dividend to be indicative of the last full financial year of Smurfit Kappa Group and very much in line with our progressive dividend policy subject to the appropriate board review and approvals. In Smurfit Westrock, we plan to be disciplined with M&A and benchmark those opportunities against all other capital allocation alternatives. The combination between Smurfit Kappa and Westrock, the integration of which will clearly be our focus was undoubtedly transformative in nature, rooted in our history of discipline and best illustrated by combining both companies on equivalent enterprise multiples to create a global leader in sustainable packaging. The balance sheet of Smurfit Westrock begins its journey with a significant strength and flexibility. A ratings upgrade from all three agencies on legacy SKG and positive outlook from two is testament to that. The track record of SKG was to deploy capital towards internal investment, be disciplined around M&A and grow the dividend over the years, while also managing to reduce our leverage. And given the strength of the balance sheet and the improved business profile through scale and reach, we do not believe our current rating will be the summer to our ambition. And the expansion of our capital allocation framework to include other forms of shareholder returns underscores the flexibility and agility of this framework and ensures that all avenues to create and return value to our shareholders are considered and benchmarked against all options. Ultimately, the framework at its simplest is about creating long-term value for all stakeholders. I'll now pass you back to Tony for some concluding remarks. Tony Smurfit Thank you, Ken. Just to remind everybody, as I said, the new Smurfit Westrock is a company that has a global leadership position in sustainable paper-based packaging products. As you can see from this slide, we cover every area that any customer, large or small would require, complemented by the best R&D and innovative tools in the industry with a world-class R&D center in Virginia and 36 innovation centers or experience centers solely focused on giving customers optimum packaging solutions. As you will have seen from the Smurfit Kappa results, we have delivered another excellent performance with the market now turning in our favor as we look forward. The current quarter looks like a low point with plenty of scope for both cyclical and structural growth as we recover and improve pricing and as we invest in the business in our usual disciplined way. As we conclude the Smurfit Kappa journey and embark on the next and exciting phase of our journey, I would like to thank our shareholders for the support they have given us through those many defining moments, which I mentioned earlier. To remind you what has made us the success that we are, we will continue to optimize our integrated model. We will continue to put customers at the center of every commercial decision. We will foster a broad-based performance-led culture that is decentralized in its nature, simplifying the business with quick decision-making and making every manager responsible for their own P&Ls treating capital as their own. As always, we will be measured, disciplined, and returns-focused in our capital allocation decisions while keeping sustainability leadership at our core. As we drive this forward in the new Smurfit Westrock through a performance-led culture, but never at the expense of our core values of loyalty, integrity and respect, and of course, safety at work. These values have delivered and will continue to do so on a much bigger platform. Smurfit Westrock has the right market positions, the right products at the right time, and most importantly, the right people. 2024 through the creation of the global leader in sustainable packaging marks the next and most exciting phase in our journey. Thanks for taking the time to listen to this. And now, we will turn it over to you to ask any questions that you have. Thank you, operator. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Charlie Muir-Sands, BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Charlie Muir-Sands Hi, good evening, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations, first of all, for closing the deal and listing. I have two questions, have plenty, but I'll limit myself to two. The first question is, apologies for the short-termism, but Tony, in your remarks, you said you thought that the current quarter looks like a cyclical low point. I just wanted to clarify, were you talking now about Q3 or Q2, do you think? Tony Smurfit Q2, Charlie, we expect prices -- price rises to be following through Q3 and Q4 and those box prices to be moving forward in Q3 and Q4 and into next year. And so clearly, with the paper price increases that are already in the marketplace and the assumption that nothing bad happens in the world but say that this seems to be the low point. Ken Bowles There is one question mark that we have to just continue to look at is some of the maintenance downtime that is in New Westrock -- sorry, in Old Westrock, I should say legacy Westrock is substantial in the second half, but we still think that should be dealable with as we look forward. Charlie Muir-Sands Then just looking a little bit further forward, at this stage, what would you envisage could be the combined run-rate for CapEx for the new business, particularly as we think into the full year 2025? Ken Bowles It's a little bit early for us to button that down, Charlie. I mean, as we've said before, there is some things to be done in legacy Westrock. I mean, Smurfit Kappa is in very good shape, although we do have some expansion projects and things like our bag and box business, which is doing very well. And we do -- we are going through legacy Westrock now as we -- as we're starting to get into the weeds a little bit. But you know, as I've said, I think to you, we've been very happy with many of the things that have already occurred in legacy Westrock. There are still some things to do and we just need to check those out over the next quarter or so before we be definitive. But you know, it won't be 1 million miles away from the model, probably it's a bit less in the year one and as a couple of projects we're still looking over as to whether or not they make sense. But overall, I would say, very happy with the asset base that we've seen. Some things to fix, but Westrock had already done quite a bit of it, especially in some of the converting areas. Charlie Muir-Sands Many thanks. Operator We will take our next question from Justin Jordan, Davy. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin Jordan Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Again, well done clearly on the merger, many decades in the planning and well done on the execution thus far. I've got, I guess, two slightly related questions. Firstly, Ken, you talked about old Smurfit Kappa having a sort of target leverage ratio of 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Can you give us any early thoughts on what target net debt to EBITDA we should be thinking about for Smurfit Westrock going forward? And secondly, related to, I suppose Charlie's question on CapEx, I just wanted to clarify clearly old Smurfit Kappa had CapEx guidance for calendar '24 of about EUR900 million or approaching $1 billion and Old Westrock, as it were, had CapEx guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. So that would imply a pro-forma CapEx of something in the neighborhood of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Is that the sort of zip code shall we say we should be thinking about or is there anything in particular you want to call out positively or negatively within that range? Ken Bowles No, I think -- just take the second one first, Justin. I think you're probably right, certainly for the remainder of '24 to kind of keep with that kind of run rate. As you know, we're coming to the end of our kind of four-year capital program. Westrock, as Tony said, has done a lot of good work. Our normal cycle will be through October and November, we start to look at budgets for '25 and then in February '25, we give you very clear size of what we think the CapEx requirements would be for '25 and then beyond if we need -- if we think that's relevant. But for now, I think you're not going to be a million miles away if you kind of stick to that kind of a zip code in terms of numbers and to keep it really simple. On the first one, I suppose, look, on a kind of simple pro-forma basis, we start off about 2.5 times. I don't think that's necessarily reflective of the enhanced business profile or reach. I think it's, you know in the rating agency world of Smurfit Westrock, while both being investment-grade companies is a new issuer in that sense. And so I think that if you like, the ambition is to be below where we currently are. But again all-in the fullness and times in terms of when we sit back and look at that kind of broader plan. But I think if you like out of the box strong investment-grade credit rating, but clearly the ambition to be north of that and that -- clearly that means sub where we are now, if you like out of the box, just 2.5 times. But again, it should be able through the year end give you better clarity and more target on that. Justin Jordan Thank you, Ken. Ken Bowles Thanks, Justin. Operator We will take our next question from George Staphos, Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. George Staphos Thanks so much, everyone. Good evening and congratulations again on the transaction. A two-part question, Tony and Ken, recognizing it's early days, as you look at the legacy corrugated and consumer businesses of Westrock, recognizing that a lot of good work had already been done by David and Alex and the prior management team, which of those two businesses is already more closely aligned to the Smurfit model, which of those businesses has maybe more opportunity to track to the Smurfit model over time to create opportunity? Relatedly, how do you feel about the systems and information that you're getting regarding Westrock? Are you getting the data, the analytics that you need? It wasn't that long ago that Westrock had had some issues in terms of its information systems or ransomware. How do you feel about the state of systems there? Thanks so much and good luck in the next period. Tony Smurfit Well, thank you, George. I'll take the first one. I think there are elements of both businesses that are very similar or will track with our businesses. I mean, if you take the CUK business, it's fully-integrated or practically fully-integrated and is a very good business and that's -- the thinking and the mindset is similar to ours. Much of their corrugator business is in line with us and obviously, some of the synergies that we're going to get is going to make it even more integrated business. There is still some work to do, George, in some of the legacy corrugated box plants and in legacy Westrock due to some of the takeovers they've done. So there's some work to do in the corrugated business there still. With regard to one of the things that is an open question is a sense is SBS Board because they don't really integrate forward fully in that business and we need to figure out over the course of the next little while is how to do that? If it's possible to do that, what is our market positioning in that? As you know, there's a lot of movements in that space with regard to a couple of acquisitions that have just been made by others in the space. So that's something that is a little bit away from where we sit in our legacy corrugated businesses and our specialty businesses. So that's something that we're going to have to take a look at. But you know they do have reasonably good or good assets in that area. So I just need to analyze that over the next period of time, so -- and to figure out where that market is going, frankly. Ken Bowles Hi, George, on the IT systems one, I think first, you mentioned the cyberattack that Westrock had a couple of years ago. I think it's fair to say that the team in Westrock responded fairly strongly to that in terms of the security architecture that they put around the organization following that and I mean, the simplest evidence of that is that we both get third-party assurance on our security frameworks. And both of us have a NIS score, which is well above the average for paper packaging and quite well set. So from that perspective, they've clearly invested in the security architecture. From a broader systems perspective, I suppose there is a bit of work to be done simply because Smurfit Kappa has had an SAP ERP environment since 1998 in reality. So whereas Westrock was really only beginning that journey in terms of win ERP system and they had chosen SAP HANA as that system, as has Smurfit Kappa for the next phase of it. So there are no burning platforms in terms of accounting systems or data systems within Westrock. I think it's as much what Tony talked about the decentralized model and if you like, aligning the kind of rollout and transition to those IT systems following the operational model who can support the best. But in the interim, access to data, the roll up of data, the aggregation data, not an issue given the current systems in Westrock, but clearly, as we begin to kind of redefine and define that operating model, the IT systems are far behind and will make that process more efficient. But a lot of commonality of systems, which is a great starting point and carrying two projects around the next version of SAP as for HANA, which means that certainly there's a lot of good work already done on both sides of the organization in terms of the next phase of IT deployment. George Staphos Thanks very much. Tony Smurfit Thanks, George. Operator We will take our next question from Lars Kjellberg, Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Lars Kjellberg Thank you and thanks for taking the questions. So coming back to what you just said Ken about decentralized operating model, which is obviously something that's been very successful at Smurfit Kappa and a few years ago, Westrock did the opposite centralizing that. What sort of actions are you taking to roll-out your sort of your business model into the legacy Westrock system? And what sort of timeframe would you have us think about that? And also on the metrics of value-based pricing on your commercial success in boxes in Europe, what are the opportunities you see in the U.S. to get to that same stage where you in a way sort of take away the strong link between containerboard and corrugated in the U.S. business as you have to a degree, at least in the European side? Ken Bowles Let me take the second question there, Lars. I mean, I would say that we have a very strong link between containerboard and corrugated. That's with why the integrated model works for us. What we intend to do is have a very clear focus on unit profitability and empowering people to ensure that they are able to make their own decisions, but overlaying that with some centralization, I mean, there is no question that we in Europe and they were in the Smurfit Westrock will always have some centralized functions that are important to support the local businesses. And that could be in areas of purchasing, it can be in areas of Pan-European or Pan-American or global accounts. There is a legal accounting. There are things that are very, very important to give to local management. But at the end of the day, at the heart of it is to empower local management to develop businesses in their own areas, to deal with their own issues in their own area and become profit centers. And that's what has worked for us through decades. And frankly speaking, the number of facilities I've been to in legacy Westrock are very excited by this because that's where a number of the operations came from, whether it's Southern Container, MeadWestvaco, people -- Gondi, those operations were very focused on central -- our decentralized profitability. And I think that's going to be a very good thing for the organization and very good thing for profitability. And ultimately, yes, that does bring higher margins and higher profitability because you go after more local accounts and you look after local accounts rather than just centralized big accounts and that unleashes entrepreneurialism, which we intend to do. We won't get it right in every factory. Not every manager is going to be able to make a transition. And but as I say, what I detect so far is huge enthusiasm for everybody for this kind of model. Tony Smurfit Yes. I think, Lars, look, a lot of other questions wrapped up in there. I think it's about full income statement responsibility rather than the idea that your purpose is to kind of cost push into the box plant, so. But it's not a model that's new to legacy Westrock model they had in place. So the journey to kind of total decentralization is not that long and not fully complete in other of areas. So it's not that the model is not understood. There's lots of people who will remember it, but it's about, as Tony said, it's getting around the pace and pushing that down and getting access to the data. So -- and if you like, understanding that the role of the central function is to support around capital allocation and take away, if you like, take away the pain of governance compliance and those things in the operations, allow the operations to do what they should be doing, which is making paper, consumer packaging and boxes. And in terms of the second one, I think Tony wraps a little up there too, which is that price over volume. In reality, you know the journey we went on there around if you like proving to our customers where we can add value to the chain, but we have to demonstrate that. And I think it's around innovation. I think it's around the ever-increasing push for sustainability and where we can kind of fit into our customers' pictures, around all those things. I think they're relatively new in the U.S. context, particularly I think around ESG and where that sits. I think particularly within that Scope 3 emissions and where we can really play part, particularly in the FMCG space. So I think the pattern and journey is not that -- going to be that dissimilar and from what we've seen in Europe. I think a lot of it though is around, again, like we have to deal with the European model is proven out in terms of the tools, technology, data experience centers, innovation centers, which also have and showing that value to our customers. And by that coming through margin as we made it come through in Smurfit Kappa. Lars Kjellberg Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Philip Ng, Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Philip Ng Hi, guys. Looking forward to working with you going forward. Lot of opportunity here. Tony and team, you guys talked about how you want to run it locally, empower local box managers to kind of help us contextualize how that ramp will happen, call it, the next few years. Appreciating the ERP system, there's work to be done on the harmonization. Those things are usually a little bumpy out of the gate. So is there any disruption that we should be mindful in terms of the P&L unpack? What kind of investments you have to make on the box side? And then from a people standpoint, you know, this is a big cultural shift. Is there a big step-up investment in the sales force and kind of relying the KPIs? So a lot to unpack, but just kind of help us contextualize and think through how this ramp-in integration is going to progress next year? Tony Smurfit So Philip, I think as I said, there's already a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of the legacy people within the company are attuned to what we're doing and excited about what we're doing. So I think -- I don't think it's going to be a bigger cultural shift as you are mentioning there. I think as I said, we've seen over 100 operations now and there's a degree of really big enthusiasm for what we're doing and what we're going to do. And we've already started some of the dismantling of some of the issues that are centralized and pushing them back to the divisions first and then ultimately down to the local level. So this is not going to be a massive cultural change for a lot of people, for some it will and some people will get on the journey and some people won't And that's just a fact of the way we're going to run the business. I think with regard to the investments that will be needed, investments are already in there, so to speak. Obviously, there'll be some more investments to be made, but they'll be based upon where we can get the best returns and the best opportunities for developing the business on a local and integrated way. And that's what we've always done, Philip, and that's what we will continue to do. So I don't think it's a -- a lot of it's very exciting journey for our people -- for these people. Ken Bowles Yes. I think Philip as well just on the disturbance point, having spent many years in many roles on the SKG side implementing IT systems. I think the one thing that you always need to be mindful of is not disturbing the business because the reality is, as my colleagues will remind me, our job is to sell boxes, it's not to put IT systems. So what we will do is to follow and support the business with as little disruption as possible. But that may mean it takes slightly longer than we might like, but it's about making sure that the business does what the business has to do because that's the most important thing. And kind of like I was saying earlier, there's no burning platforms in Westrock. So those systems can run quite happily and we can manage with them for a good period of time. But I think ultimately the idea of this is these programs and projects which are bumpy or dead rise should happen with as little noise and disturbance to the underlying business as possible. That's always the goal. Philip Ng Got you. And you guys mentioned there's work to be done in certain pockets of the legacy Westrock and harmonize Smurfit and Westrock collectively. What are some of the areas that you see the best opportunities to really unlock values on the mill side, is it in the box side? Just give us a little more perspective in terms of the opportunities there and then the $400 million synergies, what are the big buckets and how that kind of phases in? Tony Smurfit Well, I think on the -- I'll leave Ken talk about the synergies. But on the operating side, there's a bit of both, to be honest. I mean we are going to continue to operate in -- look at the mill system and make sure that we optimize that mill system; with regard to the supply chain, make sure that the mills run the grades that suit them like we do in Europe, make sure that the whole organization is focused on ensuring the lowest costs to the box plant from the integrated mill system. And obviously, with the synergies that we're bringing in the mill system, I think that's going to allow us to do that even better as we go into the second half and into the next year. With regard to the box system, there's just a few legacy box plants that really I would say that we just need to develop out to make sure that they are either going to be efficient box plants or they won't be existing. So we just need to figure out which ones those are. But as I say, the legacy Westrock business has already been doing quite a bit of that and we're going to continue on doing some of that maybe with a little bit more speed as we move forward. And on the synergy number, if you track back to the presentation back in September, Philip, you have a lot of detail, but broadly, one of the biggest focus there was around paper integration. If you remember that Smurfit capital was short about 4,00,000, 500,000 tons in -- particularly in our Latin-American business and we bought some of that paper from Westrock, not all of it. So a good chunk around paper integration. A lot of the other synergies and they're all, remember, cost synergies, there's no real revenue synergies in there. A lot around logistics and distribution, particularly around the overlap and cross between both organizations, simple things where Westrock would have shipped paper to Europe and held in external warehouses, we clearly take it into our own locations now and kind of save the cost there, which can be quite significant. So the presentation back September gives you glorious detail, but suffice to say that of those, the biggest one is integration of paper, which was always our strategic priority in the region anyway. And just to remind you that the run-rate of those is to be done by the end of 2025. Operator We will take our next question from Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gabe Hajde Tony, Ken, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start, I guess, with Global Paper and similar line of questioning as Mr. Staphos. As you evaluate that segment, I'm assuming that a portion of that is what you're talking about here in terms of forward integration. But maybe the decision tree and how you think about increasing vertical integration across the corrugated system or coming to a conclusion that maybe a mill is better served or more valuable for someone else versus yourself? Tony Smurfit Yes. Hi, Gabe. I think when we look at it, you know, I don't see a particular forward problem going forward with the corrugated papers and corrugated -- paper for corrugated. So I think if you take craft liners and white tops and medians out of this, you know, I think then we then look at some of the consumer grades and specifically SBS. And that's something we just need a little bit of time to evaluate. You know, I think there's a very good market for SBS. The question is how good is it going to be and that's something that we need some time to evaluate. I think that others are betting on the space and some are not betting on the space. And as I say, we'll look at it and decide over the next little period of time. But it has been a very good business for legacy Westrock in the past and highly profitable. And it's something that obviously, if we can see a way to integrate forward more and develop this, then we will. And if it doesn't -- isn't in that scenario, we'll reevaluate and look at it. But at the moment, I would say that it's part of the team and we'll continue to look at it as we get to know the business a bit better. Gabe Hajde I appreciate it. Thank you. And I guess for the second question, your key learnings in running your North American system, there's a lot of shake-up right now in terms of maybe how corrugated businesses are managed and run. When you look at the, maybe the food value chain specifically the food and beverage value chain over in Europe relative to the United States, there's a little bit closer linkage, I think, from merchandisers over in Europe versus the U.S. Do you see that as maybe an impediment to executing kind of some of this decentralized approach or value-based selling to your customers or more as an opportunity? Ken Bowles No, I think, Gabe, I think it's a huge opportunity. I think when you look at the innovations that we brought to our customers who are many of the same customers in Europe as they are in the United States and you look at the innovations that we brought to them in Europe, a lot of them want the same innovations in the United States and that's something that we will, it's not a magic one. We can't just come over and sprinkle some dust in the United States and everybody is going to change their way. But we are going to bring our tools and our innovation to our sales force. And over time, we will sell much more on innovation and value than going after a transactional-type business. And like others in this space, I mean it is funny how other people have been copying what we are doing. Like others in the space, we will be looking to make sure that we extract value from everything that we do. I mean, the last thing I want to be doing is putting in new machines and running lousy workovers and because that's just the way, just it fools errands. So we have always in Smurfit Kappa looked at profitability of accounts and ensuring that we are able to make money on them or if we don't make money on them initially, if we can't turn it into making money on it, we leave those accounts because you know, then you're just being busy fools. So that has been the way, that's why our margins have grown over time. We make sure that we offer value for our customers. We make sure we give them innovation. But if we don't get paid for it, we then don't do it. And that's what we've been doing for a long period of time in our history and that's what Westrock will do. So that's a very clear strategy of ours and will be to make sure that we get paid for the great work that we do. Gabe Hajde Thank you. Ken Bowles Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Gaurav Jain, Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gaurav Jain Hi, good afternoon or good evening. So two questions from me. One is that if I look at your last 12-month EBITDA at $4.5 billion, I think if I combine the peak EBITDA of both the companies, it was around $5.5 million. We had a long-term plan laid out by one of your key competitors, which is talking about doubling EBITDA over the medium-term. So can you frame the long-term opportunity here? And I'm not asking for guidance, but how high can this $4.5 billion EBITDA go in the medium-term assuming sort of normal macro conditions? Tony Smurfit Hi, Gaurav That's a question for 11 o'clock at night in Europe. Look, I think the long-term ambition has kind of been wrapped up in a lot of what we said today. I think as we start this journey, we started off with two organizations that have had quite different paths to where we get to in the sense that we're coming probably to the end of our last capital cycle, and by that the Westrock team are coming through their capital cycle, a lot of good work done. But also fundamentally, I think at a point in the cycle, if you like, from where we sit at joining together, you can consider one of the lower points in terms of where pricing is. I think even if you look back from when we did the deal to where we sit now in terms of -- we talked about it and Tony specifically talked about at the year-end in quarter one around the unsustainable levels of paper pricing, for example, in Europe and where companies have got to over the last couple of years. And since then, we've seen not only a kind of push on paper prices both side the Atlantic, but clearly a significant step-up in OCC as well. So the backdrop conditions as we begin the second half of this year and further on are clearly better. And clearly also the backdrop for recovery of those through box pricing is better through the second half and indeed what that clearly means for '25 and beyond. But I think we haven't even begun really to knit together what the total long-term opportunity of Smurfit Westrock is. I think though you've got two companies that are culturally aligned in terms of how they go to the market commercially. I think you got two companies who are innovative at their nature and two companies who traditionally have kind of brought their best up with our customers. I think it's about unpacking that on a global scale to be what we are, which is the largest and the most sustainable packaging partner on the planet. And -- but that also will take time, as Tony has said. But it's clear from our interactions over the -- the soft interactions over the last 9 months, plus the excitement and energy and enthusiasm that we feel as we go around the organization post-close and that there's a willingness, if you like, from the Smurfit side and the Westrock side to make sure the thing is nothing but a roaring success. And that clearly is backed up by the disciplines around capital allocation, internal investment, and the returns focus that brings with the attention to in terms of the end-customer and what they need, not just, if you like, day-to-day, but the longer term as opportunity because we do exist in an industry that is secularly in a good shape with a product, as Tony said, in the right place, right time is what the world needs. And I think that's only ever going to grow because the consumer continues to desire ever more sustainable products and in reality, where corrugated or consumer packaging can replace the less sustainable substrates, it's clearly still making that shift. So I think in time, we probably frame that longer-term opportunity a lot better, but I think it's fair to say that we start off in a great place and a reality with the backdrop of an industry, that's also in a great place. Gaurav Jain Sure. Thank you so much. And my second question is that, so we will get the first-quarter next time for the combined company. So what would be the metrics on which you would guide on a quarterly basis or you would not guide at all or would it be something like an adjusted EBITDA number or free cash flow or EPS? Like what is going to be the key metric? Tony Smurfit We haven't kind of settled them out. The key metrics are probably the ones you see in this release. In reality, we've tended to focus on Smurfit Kappa on EBITDA, clearly the margin quite specifically. And indeed both organizations traditionally have been strong free cash flow generators. I think whether we guide on a quarterly basis or annual is to be decided, but I think we -- generally, we've always guided annually because I think it gives you a better feel for the year and you stop getting trapped into the weeds of kind of quarter-to-quarter analysis and allows you to focus much more on the longer-term and much more thematic drivers of an industry rather than getting caught up on the kind of [indiscernible], but all three decide on play those. Gaurav Jain Thank you so much. Tony Smurfit Thank you, Gaurav. Operator That is all the time we have for question-and-answer session for today. So I will hand you back to Tony Smurfit for closing remarks. Tony Smurfit Yes. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. I think we have put together an incredible company. This is going to be a company that will deliver great results as we go forward. And this is a company that is going to be a company that is a leader in its field. It's a company that has got really great people. It will have great assets and it'd be incredibly uniquely positioned to deliver superior returns along with our vision as we go forward. So I thank you all. Thank you for your support. It was a momentous day this July 8th or July 5th, I should say, and we look forward to continuing to deliver for this company going forward. Thank you all for joining. Operator Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "text": "Investing in your work pension is the easiest way to get richer: SIMON LAMBERT How to make the most of your work pension and check if it's up to scratch By Simon Lambert for Thisismoney.co.uk Updated: 02:00 EDT, 4 October 2024 e-mail View comments The two main routes for most people to grow their wealth over a lifetime will be buying a home and investing in a work pension. House prices don’t always go up but over the typical 30-year mortgage period you’d be very unlucky not to see your home grow in value. Even if it didn’t you would have taken advantage of how a repayment mortgage works as a great long-term savings scheme – as at the end of term you own a property worth hundreds of thousands of pounds outright. Unfortunately, sky-high house prices mean there is a substantial barrier to entry for this generation of first-time buyers . In contrast, investing into your work pension is simple, can be done with relatively small sums of money – and gets you extra cash off the government and your employer too. Shake your moneymaker: Your work pension is an easy way to get rich over the long-term Read More How pensions work: Your guide to saving for a richer retirement This column focusses on what are known as defined contribution pensions, where you invest to build up a pot for retirement. This is what most employees get nowadays, especially in the private sector. In the public sector, things are different and defined benefit pensions are still offered. These allow workers to build up a set annual income in retirement that the employer is responsible for, based on how many years they work there. If you are offered a defined benefit pension, take it. In the meantime, here's why defined contribution work pensions can be a serious long-term wealth builder. Under auto-enrolment someone earning £30,000 a year, can get £231.25 into their pension each month at a cost of just £125 to them. The worker pays in 5 per cent of their £2,500 monthly earnings at £125, their employer tops it up by 3 per cent at £75, and the government adds £31.25 in pension tax relief . The magic of compounding returns means the longer you do this for the better, as This is Money's long-term saving calculator shows. Save £231.25 monthly for 30 years with an average 6 per cent return and you end up with £232,294 Do the same for 40 years and your pot at the end would be £460,532. The scenario there is basic, but it highlights how our work pensions can be serious money-making machines. And there is even better news, as many employers offer more generous pensions than auto-enrolment demands. Yet, most of us totally fail to engage with this easy way of growing our wealth. So, is your work pension up to scratch? These would be my main things to look for: Employer contributions Under auto-enrolment you pay in 5 per cent of your earnings, while your employer must pay in 3 per cent. But many companies offer more, so sign up to the improved scheme if you can. You want your employer to be generous in matching contributions up to a decent level, for example 6 or 7 per cent. Hopefully, for long-term pension scheme members they may even do more than match contributions, for example, multiplying them by 1.5 or doubling them. In these cases, the maximum contribution you can get this on may be lower, such as 5 per cent, but the benefit you get is greater. Pension charges In most cases, work pension schemes will not charge you for buying and selling investments, but they will charge you for holding them. This cost may be split into two charges: one for the pension platform or wrapper itself and another for fund charges. Alternatively, the two elements may be rolled into one overall charge. If you can't find this information or understand it, ask. There is a cap of 0.75 per cent on workplace pension charges but that only applies to default funds. If you pick other funds yourself, the cost may be higher. Watch out for this. > DIY investing platforms and Sipps: What they charge Work pensions vs Sipps: Steve Webb and Simon Lambert discuss The This is Money podcast recently welcomed Sir Steve Webb for a special episode where he answered listeners' questions on everything you need to know about pensions. In this excerpt, Steve and Simon Lambert discuss whether you should invest in a work pension or Sipp - and how to make the most of them.

Default funds Work pension schemes will offer default funds - the ones you are put into if you don't actively choose differently. The vast majority stick with default funds, which are usually relatively cheap, broad, global tracker funds that enable you to invest all around the world at a low cost. These can be good quality but some are better than others. Look at what your default fund costs, how it works and what it invests in. Default options may do something called lifestyling and shift your investment mix depending on your investing time horizon. Check if your fund does this and how – and make sure it fits with your own investment outlook and appetite for risk. Some pensions use what are known as master trusts, these are big funds provide a workplace pension scheme that can be used by multiple unrelated employers. The biggest example is Nest, the workplace pension master trust set up by government. Pension fund choice Beyond their default funds, work pension schemes can offer wildly different selections of funds. The choice is generally controlled by a mix of the pension scheme manager and your employer. To those used to free range investment platforms, the choice might feel restrictive but your employer may want to protect you from going all in on a high risk investment fund. Check how good the choices are and how they compare to the building block funds and broader options at a DIY investment platform . Easy to understand You want your work pension scheme to be simple, explain what you need to know, make it easy to find important information, be user-friendly if switching funds and have an easy-to-understand pension projection. Ultimately, you should be able to log in, find what you need and do what you want to do, without the whole thing feeling mystifying. If your pension falls short, push for change If you don't think your work pension stacks up well on any of these measures, push for change. The way to make work pension schemes better and build a richer retirement for us all is to engage with them.

    "title": "Saudi Arabia slashes growth forecasts, sees wider budget deficits",
    "text": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Xavierarnau | E+ | Getty Images Saudi Arabia cut its growth forecasts and raised its budget deficit estimates for the fiscal years 2024 to 2026, looking ahead to a period of higher spending and lower projected oil revenues. Real gross domestic product is now expected to grow 0.8% this year, a dramatic drop from a previous estimate of 4.4%, according to the latest pre-budget report published by the Ministry of Finance on Monday. The GDP growth projection for 2025 has also been cut from a previous estimate of 5.7% to 4.6%; while the outlook for 2026 has been trimmed from 5.1% to 3.5%. \"The FY2025 budget highlights the Kingdom's commitment to accelerate the regulatory and structural reforms, as well as the development of policies,\" the pre-budget report read. \"It also focuses on transformative spending to promote sustainable economic growth, improve social development, and enhance quality of life.\" The latest report further emphasized the Saudi government's plans to deploy sovereign and development funds \"for capital investment while empowering both the private and non-profit sectors to foster growth and prosperity.\" Saudi authorities also expect that the budget will remain in deficit for the next several years, as the kingdom prioritizes spending to achieve the targets of its Vision 2030 plan to modernize and diversify the heavily oil-dependent Saudi economy. The Finance Ministry projected a wider budget shortfall of about 2.9% of GDP for 2024, compared with a previous projection of 1.9% for the year. It predicted deficits of 2.3% and 2.9% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, also wider than previous estimates. watch now VIDEO 3:31 03:31 Analyst discusses Saudi Arabia's $100-per-barrel oil price target Capital Connection Saudi Arabia's fiscal breakeven oil price — what it needs a barrel of crude to cost in order to balance its government budget — has increased in recent months and years and may well rise higher along with spending increases. The IMF's latest forecast released in April put that fiscal breakeven figure at $96.20 for 2024, marking a roughly 19% increase on the year before. The figure is also about 36% higher than the current price of a barrel of Brent crude, which was trading at around $70.70 as of Tuesday afternoon. Oil prices are expected to remain subdued at least in the medium-term amid slowing demand and increased supply globally. Saudi Arabia is hosting major international events that will require steep spending — like the World Cup 2034 and Expo 2030 — as well as building out multi-trillion dollar megaprojects like Neom, which is backed by the kingdom's mammoth sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. watch now VIDEO 2:50 02:50 Lower oil prices are the 'new normal'; price to range $70-$80/bbl: Kpler Street Signs Asia \"Saudi Arabia's GDP dances to the rhythm of oil, and with recent data from the Ministry of Finance, it's clear that as oil gushes, so does the economy,\" Tarik Solomon, chairman emeritus at the American Chamber of Commerce in Saudi Arabia, told CNBC. \"But when the wells slow, so does the growth.\" Saudi Arabia's public debt has grown from around 3% of its GDP in the 2010s to roughly 28% today, according to the International Monetary Fund — a huge jump, but still low by international standards. Public debt in EU countries, for instance, averages 82%. In the U.S. in 2023, that figure was 123%. Its relatively low debt level and high credit rating makes it easier for Saudi Arabia to take on more debt as it needs to. The kingdom has also rolled out a series of reforms to boost and de-risk foreign investment and diversify revenue streams. While the country's economy has contracted for the last consecutive four quarters, non-oil economic activity grew 4.4% in the second quarter year-on-year, up 3.4% in the previous quarter. watch now VIDEO 3:19 03:19 Saudi Arabia's non-oil growth is proving to be 'robust,' economist says Capital Connection",

    "title": "Canada needs to overhaul the Temporary Foreign Worker program, not just tinker with it",
    "text": "The federal government recently announced important changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker program , a program that allows Canadian employers to hire foreign nationals to fill labour shortages at low wages. As of Sept. 26, 2024 , the federal government will stop processing employer requests for temporary foreign workers in cities with an unemployment rate of six per cent or higher, with limited exceptions. The government will also limit employers’ hiring of temporary foreign workers to no more than 10 per cent of their total workforce, a limit that was in place before the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum duration of employment for workers hired through the low-wage stream will be reduced to one year from two years. Unfortunately, these changes still fall far short of the reforms needed to address the program’s deeper issues. A United Nations special rapporteur has described the program as a “ breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery ,” highlighting the urgent need for far more comprehensive reforms. Rise in temporary foreign workers The Temporary Foreign Worker program was established to provide a temporary solution to labour shortages , allowing employers to hire foreign workers on a temporary basis when Canadian workers can’t be found. The program was originally intended as a short-term solution, meant to supplement the domestic workforce rather than replace it. In recent years, however, an increasing number of employers have been hiring temporary foreign workers to fill vacant jobs in their organizations, even as unemployment rises in Canada . This significant increase suggests that employers are increasingly depending on foreign labour to fill positions that, in the past, might have been filled by Canadian workers. The rise in temporary foreign workers is particularly pronounced in certain sectors, and there has been a significant rise in the number of positions that have been approved for temporary foreign workers. Between 2018 and 2023, the number of temporary foreign workers more than doubled according to data from Employment and Social Development Canada , increasing from 108,988 in 2018 to just under 240,000 in 2023. For instance, the number of approvals for food counter attendants, kitchen helpers and related occupations rose by 4,802 per cent between 2018 and 2023. Similarly, approvals for administrative assistants rose by 1,063 per cent, while light duty cleaners saw a 1,414 per cent increase. These changes are expected to affect the retail, accommodation and food service sectors the most. An exploitive system Nothing is being done to change the exploitive system that gives employers steady access to low-wage, vulnerable migrant workers with precarious work and immigration status. Temporary foreign workers in this program are tied to their employers through closed work permits that only allow them to work for the employer who applied to bring them to Canada for the length of time specified. Typically, they must leave Canada when their temporary job ends. Quitting or finding another job is not an option, forcing workers to stay in jobs that are often exploitative. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology released a report in May recommending that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada stop issuing these closed work permits. These employment terms create conditions for wage theft, excessive work hours, limited breaks and physical abuse. These issues were highlighted in a final report from the UN’s special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery , Tomoya Obokata. The special rapporteur also called attention to little information provided to these workers on their rights and the lack of enforcement measures to deal with exploitative employers or labour brokers who charge workers exorbitant fees to arrange their paperwork and job in Canada, often leaving workers in debt. It’s clear temporary foreign workers are not a short-term solution for perceived labour shortages, but are instead an entrenched element of Canada’s changing workforce. These workers remain in precarious temporary work even after years of living and working in Canada without ever getting any closer to achieving permanent residency, not to mention Canadian citizenship. Good enough to work, good enough to stay There should be permanent residency and a path to citizenship for all workers entering Canada. As the United Food and Commercial Workers Union has put it , if a person is “good enough to work” in Canada, then they are certainly “good enough to stay.” However, few temporary foreign workers, especially in the Low Wage stream, become permanent Canadian citizens. Union membership and permanent residency remain the only real solutions to the exploitive working conditions and employment system for temporary foreign workers. The Canadian Labour Congress has been a vocal advocate for reform, calling on the government to take concrete steps to improve protections for workers in the low-wage Temporary Foreign Worker program. These steps include: Replacing the employer-specific work permits with open work permits; Providing permanent residency opportunities for low-wage workers; and Provide permanent residency opportunities for former low-wage workers who are undocumented. By creating pathways to permanent residency and citizenship, Canada can ensure these workers, who contribute so much to the economy, are treated with more dignity and respect. Rather than tinkering around the edges, the federal government needs to fundamentally overhaul the Temporary Foreign Worker program to end the exploitation of these workers.",

    "title": "Corpay's Q2 Success: Payment Powerhouse Poised For Global Growth",
    "text": "J Studios/DigitalVision via Getty Images Thesis My analysis suggests Corpay, Inc. ( CPAY ) is poised for growth, especially in Corporate Payments and international markets, and the company’s recent Q2 2024 earnings and outlook back this up, which I'll cover in this article. As for the latter, non-GAAP EPS hit $4.55 , beating estimates by $0.04. Seeking Alpha And revenue came in at $975.7 million , right on target. Seeking Alpha In my research, I argue that Corpay’s smart acquisitions and focus on expanding its payment solutions keep it in a strong position. For growth-focused investors, it looks like a good bet. About Corpay, Inc. Corpay, Inc., a big name in global corporate payments, focuses on modern solutions to streamline business expenses. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Corpay is part of the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) . In 2023, the company pulled in $3.8 billion in revenue. Seeking Alpha Founded as FLEETCOR Technologies in 2000, the company started with regional fuel cards. Over time, they grew by making strategic acquisitions. By 2024, they rebranded to Corpay to better match their wide range of payment services, including accounts payable automation, cross-border payments, vehicle payments, and lodging payments. To break it down, Corpay is a payment solutions business that simplifies financial management by offering solutions to streamline accounts payable (AP) to disburse suppliers’ payments, cross-border payments worldwide with real-time exchange rates and risk management tools; a suite of commercial cards to enhance control and tracking of business expenses (such as business travel, corporate cards, virtual cards, and more); a vehicle payment solution to manage fuel and maintenance expenses for companies that manage their fleet of vehicles; a lodging payment system to manage hotel bookings and expenses as part of a business travel program; and risk management tools to help manage cash flow and currency fluctuations. Corpay is also known for its tech integration , with a focus on syncing its solutions and services with existing financial systems for all industries (think manufacturing, healthcare, entertainment, and finance, all sizes, small or mega), both local and international. Corpay serves over 800,000 business clients worldwide, solidifying its place in corporate payments. The company continues to grow, like when it bought Paymerang back in May, an accounts payable automation firm, for $475 million. Corpay’s CEO, Ron Clarke, has led the company since its start, driving its growth from a niche service to a global leader in corporate payments. I make a point to mention CEO Clarke, whom Dan Loeb , the American hedge fund manager of Third Point, once said on Seeking Alpha that he “belongs on the Mount Rushmore of capital allocators.” In the past six months, Clarke led Corpay in deploying over $2 billion in M&A and share repurchases, which Loeb believes will boost 2025 earnings by 7%. Corpay's Market Performance Fast Graphs Looking at CPAY compared to the broader market, specifically the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ), a few things stand out to me: the stock price jumped from $148.40 in January 2017 to $311.02 in August 2024, definitely a solid 110% increase , but when you stack that against SPY, it doesn't shine as bright. That's because SPY not only grew more but also paid dividends along the way. That is, Corpay’s annualized return of 10.16% without dividends doesn’t keep up with SPY’s 12.48%. Toss in those dividends, and SPY’s compound growth rate hits 13.58%, leaving Corpay’s 10.16% lagging. Fast Graphs For growth-oriented investors (like myself), Corpay not paying dividends isn't a big deal because they’re plowing profits back into the business instead of paying shareholders, and that's necessary for long-term growth. Bottom line here: Corpay has room to grow, but for income seekers, the lack of dividends and its lag SPY will give them cause for pause. Corpay’s Q2 2024 Earnings Highlights In Q2 2024, Corpay pulled in $976 million in revenue, up 7% (without their Russia business which sold in August 2023), hitting the high end of their goals. Cash EPS jumped 14% to $4.55, beating their midpoint by $0.05. Furthermore, business trends picked up — CEO Clarke noted “noticeable” trend improvements in all three of their key businesses with retention rates almost at 92%, a 100 basis point gain from last year. Same-store sales flattened out, improving by 2% sequentially. New bookings shot up 21%, fueled by a 28% boost in Corporate Payments sales. The Corporate Payments segment had a standout quarter , with revenue up 18% and spend volume rising 19%. Sales in this segment soared 34%, with card penetration growing by 6% to over 11%. Management expects Corporate Payments to make up 40% of Corpay’s portfolio by next year, up from 30% now. International operations performed very well, especially in Brazil, where revenue jumped 20% and sales shot up 27%. Brazil’s business is “clicking on all cylinders.” The business of selling toll tags is doing brisk business—it has sold 9% more tags just in this quarter—because the tags have been made available in so many places: at toll booths, at malls and retail outlets, in new cars, and anywhere people drive. Much more interesting is how they are getting existing customers to spend more through additional services , such as fuel and car-oriented products. One such service, for dealing with traffic tickets and car registrations, has grown by 40% in a quarter. They put reminders for these services on the app’s homepage, which leads to more sales, something management noted several times on the conference call as a “snowballing” effect happening in Brazil. The international fleet business, especially in Australia and the UK, also boosted performance . Strategic buys were key here. The Paymerang deal, according to management, should add $25-35 million to H2 revenue, while the GPS acquisition is set to bring in over $125 million by 2025. These moves are expected to significantly boost earnings, thanks to synergies. By synergies , you can imagine that as the “shattering (breaking down of) the acquired IT systems” of Paymerang and GPS and consolidating them into their own, whereby the company anticipates reducing expenses related to maintaining multiple systems. Furthermore, they plan to use a “broader product line to increase revenues” by cross-selling the newly acquired payment products to their existing customer base, which will help sales grow. They plan to streamline back-office operations to achieve a “significant streamlining of G&A” to help cut costs and increase efficiency. Altogether, these synergies will contribute roughly “$0.50 of accretion” to earnings next year, so these strategic synergistic moves will have a meaningful profitability boost. Moving forward, Corpay is holding its guidance for the full-year 2024 with $4 billion in revenue and $19 in cash EPS, along with higher revenue growth in Q4 and $21 in run-rate cash EPS by 2025. Sequential revenue growth is expected, with margins expanding 200 to 250 basis points from Q2 to Q4. There is strong operating leverage in the model, with a margin flow-through rate of 80-90% on additional revenue. Corpay intends to dispose of vehicle-related assets of up to $400 million , which should presumably go to fund share buybacks to offset dilution. The underperforming North American fleet and lodging operations are now back in growth mode, and should see organic revenue growth in Q4. And finally, financial management is robust, with $325 million of free cash flow generated in Q2 and EBITDA margin widening to 53.1% due to tight expense control and reductions in bad debt. Corpay’s Valuation CPAY's blended P/E ratio is 17.00x looks cheap to me compared to its usual 19.78x. This could mean the stock is a bit undervalued , especially with its solid earnings growth. Fast Graphs An earnings yield of 5.88% shows Corpay is making good money, and their 14.26% earnings growth rate backs that up. The BB+ credit rating is decent but not perfect, most likely due to Corpay's debt load, with a 47.77% debt-to-capital ratio. But keep in mind, the company has a strong expense discipline ethic reflected in their bad debt expense dropping $7 million this quarter, or 20%, from last year, landing at $28 million, which is 5 basis points of total spend. Corpay’s Risks & Headwinds On a less positive note, there’s been very little revenue growth impact from the North American fleet and lodging businesses, an area that dropped revenue by 10% in Q2. While both segments appear to have stabilized, they’re not really growing at this point; management describes them as flat, not accelerating. Corpay also faces broader challenges like weaker foreign exchange rates and lower fuel prices, which will likely hit revenue in late 2024. There are fewer flight cancellations and homeowner insurance claims, an issue management expects to continue, with flat room nights expected in Q3 and a seasonal Q4 dip. While organic revenue was up 6%, the growth wasn’t evenly spread across segments, with some areas dragging. The Paymerang acquisition pushed leverage to 2.8x, and while this was within their target, it would still be risky if cash flows came in short of expectations. Rising interest expenses ($6 million more than last year because of higher rates and more debt) could drag on profits if rates stay high. Even with an expected $400 million in divestitures, dilution would likely ensue if stock buybacks do not fully offset the company’s acquisitions. Lastly, the company also cited unsettled macroeconomic conditions, which meant results could come in at the lower end of its guidance. Much of the expected growth in the back half of the year would be seasonal, particularly gift card-related revenue, which could be unsustainable long term. Consider that the company counts on a big seasonal boost from the gift card business to drive revenue growth in the second half of the year. Corpay's Rating I rate Corpay, Inc. a “Buy” as the company’s growth looks good, particularly in Corporate Payments and the international arena; meanwhile, the pipeline of growth drivers, such as the acquisitions of Paymerang and GPS, along with new markets like Brazil, should give earnings a nice punch. Risks (always) abound, including the higher debt load I mentioned (with possible dilution risk) and flat spots in a few areas. But, all in all, considering strong earnings growth, an undervalued stock, and solid cash flow, Corpay, Inc. stock looks like a winner to me for the growth-oriented investor.

    "title": "China's Reluctance To Empower Corporations Could Undermine Economic Stimulus: Report",
    "text": "China’s latest economic stimulus is creating significant ripples in global markets. Following a series of bold actions by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), including slashing the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks and cutting key repo rates, the financial system is poised for an influx of liquidity . The aim is to inject $140 billion into the economy and enhance lending to stimulate growth. Additionally, Reuters reports that China plans to issue 2 trillion yuan (approximately $284 billion) in special sovereign bonds this year to boost consumer spending. However, Nick Colas , co-founder of DataTrek Research , cautioned about the challenges posed by the Chinese government’s approach. During a Bloomberg Surveillance podcast , he noted that while there are various monetary and fiscal policy measures, there exists a conflicting perspective among government regulators. They want to improve the economy but are reluctant to restore too much power to the wealthy and corporations. “And that tension has been really damaging for Chinese equity market investors sentiments,” Colas said in the podcast. Colas emphasized that this tension has negatively impacted investor sentiment in the Chinese equity market. Also Read: China’s Stimulus Sparks Optimism: 3 Large-Cap Stocks With Analyst Buy Ratings Colas also drew a comparison between China and the United States regarding their resilience. He expressed that America, by its very nature, is psychologically “anti-fragile.” “Americans are very optimistic people. They don’t worry about making mistakes. And they don’t criticize people that fail, at least in business,” Colas said on the Bloomberg Surveillance Podcast. He remarked that American society allows for “second and third acts,” highlighting a cultural tendency to bounce back from setbacks. When asked about China’s anti-fragility, Colas acknowledged that it exists but not to the same degree as in the U.S. He pointed out that the unique ability of Americans to recover from mistakes—whether in business or politics—sets the U.S. apart globally. This resilience, he concluded, is a hallmark of American exceptionalism. A recent Bloomberg report highlighted that a growing group of prominent Chinese economists, including former central bank chief Yi Gang , has warned of the need to boost demand to prevent China from falling into a deflationary spiral. Companies engaged in intense price wars are laying off workers, and college graduates are facing challenges in finding jobs, leading to a record youth unemployment rate last month, the report read. While the new multi-faceted policy package has energized equity markets, it did not do much to tackle the fundamental issues affecting China’s long-term economic outlook.

Plaintiff alleges that on October 24, 2024, before the market opened, Lilium disclosed that it had been unable to raise sufficient additional funds to continue the operations of the Company’s principal operating wholly owned German subsidiaries.

The complaint further alleges that on November 4, 2024, before the market opened, the Company reported that, following the insolvency of the Company’s subsidiaries, Lilium had not been able to raise sufficient additional funds to conduct its ongoing business consistent with past practice. The Company disclosed that “funding for the Company is not feasible.” As a consequence, the Company would be “obliged to file for insolvency.” On this news, Lilium’s stock price fell 15.5%, to close at $0.083 per share on November 4, 2024.

    "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday (October 23, 2024) set aside a judgment of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) allowing a ₹158 crore settlement between ed-tech firm Byju’s with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud said there was “grave deviation from procedure” in bringing the case to the NCLAT itself. Also read | Neck deep in trouble, will BYJU’S still be able to bounce back? The Bench upheld the locus standi of U.S.-based creditor Glas Trust Company LLC which had filed the appeal against the NCLAT decision. The court said Glas had raised “reasonable apprehensions”. The judgment authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud directed ₹158 crore and accrued interest in an escrow account to be shifted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The CoC would deposit the amount in the escrow account. The court was careful not to comment on the merits of the case. During back-to-back hearing in the case, the apex court had questioned whether the BCCI could be allowed to strike a “personal agreement” with Byju’s promoter and “walk away” with its money. The U.S. lender had said, as a major financial creditor, it should have got priority in repayments. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for BCCI, had submitted that the ₹ 158 crore was offered by Riju Raveendran, Byju’s brother, from his personal assets. The money was not tainted. The NCLAT, on August 2, granted relief to the embattled ed-tech firm by setting aside the insolvency proceedings after approving a ₹158.9 crore dues settlement with the BCCI. Byju’s had entered into a Team Sponsor Agreement with the BCCI in 2019.

    "title": "India to work with rest of Brics countries to further ease trade",
    "text": "India's trade with BRICS countries may be poised for a take-off as officials work to extend customs-related privileges to ed merchants from these nations, which would also fetch similar benefits to Indian exporters to those markets, two persons familiar with the matter said. While such a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) is already in place with Russia, the next one will be signed with South Africa, one of the two people said. “This is expected by the end of January 2025. Work has already started to sign a similar deal with Brazil,\" the person said on the condition of anonymity. This may be followed by negotiations for a similar pact with China, India's immediate neighbour and biggest trading partner. Once the agreements are signed, India would speed up customs clearances for so-called authorized economic operators (AEOs) from these countries, reduce inspection levels, allow deferred duty payments and quicker tax refunds for their partners in India who are not covered by India’s own AEO programme, and accept self-declaration on the origin of goods. The same benefits will be available to Indian merchants, customs brokers and logistics players involved in trade with the partner country. Queries emailed to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Union finance ministry and the Chinese embassy in New Delhi seeking comments for the story remained unanswered. Extending customs-related privileges is common in international trade to boost goods movement. The European Union operates an AEO scheme across all its member states. Countries including China, Singapore, South Korea, US and Canada have AEO programmes. In certain countries, the scheme is known by a different name, for example, as Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) in the US. India's latest effort in this respect is essentially an integration of the AEO scheme with BRICS nations. Enhancing cooperation in trade and customs is the next logical step, explained Biswajit Dhar, distinguished professor at the Council for Social Development. The freeze in bilateral relations, which had spilled over to economic matters, has now been lifted at the political level, and overall, there could be a lot of cooperation between India and China, said Dhar. “It would also pave the way for the removal of uncertainties and a new beginning in economic ties between the two nations in 2025,\" said Dhar. India's traditionally strong petroleum, gems and jewellery exports fell steeply in the first half of this fiscal year, hurt by slow growth in developed countries, although pharmaceutical, electronics and engineering goods bucked the trend, commerce ministry data showed. India’s trade with BRICS nations expanded 8.3% annually to $215.3 billion in FY24, as per official data from the commerce ministry. A second person said the road is clear for negotiating a similar deal with China, a major trade partner and India’s largest source of imports. “However, work is yet to start. There are many factors to be taken into account,\" said the person. A deal with China could help Indian exporters as India has a huge trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy. India's expanding network of MRAs with countries like South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, USA, UAE, Australia, and Russia, along with the ongoing negotiations with BRICS nations, marks a significant stride towards streamlined trade and enhanced global partnerships, said Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner, EY. This promises to reduce compliance burden, foster trust among trade partners, and solidify India's position as a trusted and interconnected trade hub within the BRICS bloc and internationally, said Agarwal. The recent border disengagement with China and the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia are seen as major milestones in bilateral ties, with both nations committing to work on shared development goals. An Indian statement on 23 October said the leaders underlined the need to progress bilateral relations from long-term perspective and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges, while China’s foreign ministry said, “Development is now the biggest shared goal of China and India.\" In recent months, economists in the Indian government had underscored the need for attracting FDI from China to boost India’s manufacturing sector. More MRAs would be a game changer for Indian businesses, said Abhishek Jain, Indirect Tax Head and Partner at KPMG. “They would help simplify trade processes, increase market access and trade partnerships with nations. It will better India’s position as a trusted global partner,\" said Jain.",

    "title": "Time To Get Out Of The Pool Corp",
    "text": "Oliver Rossi/DigitalVision via Getty Images There have been 13 articles written about Pool Corporation ( NASDAQ: POOL ) in Seeking Alpha in the past year. The last 12 either had sell or hold ratings. Being a contrarian, I tend to go the opposite direction of the market. But after taking a hard look, it's clear that my fellow authors have been right, and will likely continue to be right. There is nothing wrong with POOL as a company or with its management. The issue is an excessive valuation going into a period of declining results after a Covid-induced surge. The most important section of this report is the valuation section. I will compare POOL to its peers and make adjustments to reach a valuation. But also take a hard look at the 17 headwinds facing this company. I don't do much shorting of stocks. But my best idea right now happens to be shorting POOL. Shorting is normally like spitting into the wind. The average stock goes up around 10% a year, and that's a big headwind to overcome, when you expect it to go down. An investor needs to be very confident. This report will explain why I am so with POOL. Background POOL describes itself as the world's largest wholesale distributor of pool supplies and one of the largest distributors of irrigation supplies. As of December 31, 2023, it had 439 sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia. About 95% of sales are in North America. In 2023, maintenance and minor repair items were 62% of total sales, products used in the remodeling and renovation of pools were 24%, and products used for construction and installation were 14%. Their largest product category was pool chemicals, with 14% of sales in 2023. Irrigation parts and supplies were also about 14% of sales in 2023. POOL pays a small dividend, currently yielding 1.5%. Financials Financial results for the last 5 years and the most recent quarter are shown below. Five years are used to show what it looked like in 2019, the last pre-Covid year. SEC filings What is immediately clear in the chart above is that revenues and earnings surged during the Covid pandemic, as people reduced travel and spent more money on leisure at home. That surge started in 2020, but primarily occurred in 2021 and 2022. To a lesser extent, revenues and earnings also benefitted from acquisitions. Money spent on acquisitions totaled $831 million in those years, mostly in 2021. Like many Covid beneficiaries, demand was pulled forward, and is now starting to unwind. EPS declined 28% in 2023, but was still well above pre-Covid levels. In the first quarter of 2024, EPS declined another 25% YoY. The first quarter is of course a seasonally slower period. The stock didn't move much with that earnings report, as EPS actually beat estimates. POOL has a very clean income statement versus most similar sized publicly traded companies, meaning there are few non-recurring items in any given year. That makes it easier to analyze and predict. The balance sheet is moderately leveraged. Net worth was $1.35 billion on March 31, 2024, but tangible net worth was only $350 million. Interest bearing debt was $979 million on that date. Debt is much higher than tangible net worth, but this is not currently a problem due to strong cash flow. POOL paid down interest bearing debt by $387 million over the year ended March 31, 2024 through profits and by lowering inventories by $190 million. Guidance On June 24, 2024, the hammer came down. Management pre-announced a drop in EPS guidance for 2024 from $13.19 to $14.19 to a much lower $11.04 to $11.44. That is an 18% decline using the midpoint. It is also down from adjusted earnings of $13.18 in 2023. They also guided the second quarter to $4.90 at the midpoint. The analysts were estimating $5.85. This indicates that the second half of the year will have an EPS of $4.49, which is down about 25% from what they had been guiding for. They added the following comments to the pre-announcement: \"We now believe that new pool units could be down 15% to 20% in 2024, and remodeling activity for 2024 may be down as much as 15% compared to our previous estimate of flat to down 10% compared to 2023.\" Earnings are scheduled to be announced on July 25. Headwinds I spend a lot of time in my articles looking at the positives and negatives. I usually refer to negatives as risks or headwinds. They are a way to get behind the numbers into what is really going on. In a short period of time, a number of headwinds have popped up to impact POOL's operating results. Few show signs of going away. These are listed below: 1. Pulled forward demand - Reversion to the mean is a powerful economic force when demand has clearly been pulled forward. The surge in sales in 2021 and 2022 left less people needing to build, renovate or repair their pools. The reversion does not appear close to over. EPS is still well above pre-Covid levels, even if you factor in a higher installed base of pools and acquisitions. Large mean reversions are known to often overshoot in the other direction. 2. Less home building - The charts below show new single-family homes sold are dropping rapidly and suddenly versus last year. New pools are often tied to new homes. So, less new homes means less demand for new pools. The Daily Shot 3. Homes too expensive - Mortgage payments for home purchases are now about double what they were pre-Covid. That leaves much less cash flow for homeowners to add, fix to renovate pools. Redfin 4. Big guidance drop - Two weeks ago, management dropped EPS estimates for 2024 by 18%. The drop is even bigger for the back half of the year, since this drop was after POOL reported first quarter numbers. What's worse is the quarter they dropped it on, is their seasonally strongest quarter. That basically means there is little chance of getting back to their earlier guidance of 2024. The analysts' average 2024 revenue estimate is now down 5.7% versus 2023. 5. The economy is slowing - The chart below shows a sudden surge in negative economic reports. POOL is a very cyclical company. In fact, its stock lost about two thirds of its value during the last real recession in 2007-2009. Bloomberg 6. High P/E ratio - This may be my most important point. The guided EPS of $11.24 at the midpoint, indicates a P/E ratio of 27. That is way too high for a company with declining sales and earnings. 7. Momentum market - Positive momentum stocks have outperformed the market in a big way in 2024 to date as shown below. POOL has negative earnings and price momentum. The Daily Shot 8. Peak EPS too low - Peak EPS was $18.70 in 2022, a year when everything went right. Those conditions are unlikely to reoccur anytime soon. POOL stock is still trading at 16x peak earnings. That's very high for a cyclical company. 9. Peers are also suffering - Most peers that specialize in large discretionary purchases for leisure are struggling too. More on this in the valuation section. 10. Water shortage - Parts of the country are facing serious water shortages. This is especially true in the American Southwest and California, 2 of POOL's largest markets. That could lead to water rationing, causing less pool usage and new construction. 11. Capex above depreciation - Capex has significantly exceeded depreciation and amortization in each of the last 3 years and the last quarter. In 2023, it exceeded by $29 million. This indicates that cash flow isn't as strong as earnings make it appear. 12. Weak insider support - Officers and directors only own 3% of the company. There have been significant insider sales over the past 6 months with nominal purchases. When options were exercised, the acquired stock was 100% sold. 13. Stock decline is well below guidance decline - The stock is only down about 10% since the big guidance cut. Guidance was cut much more, 18-25% depending on the time period. 14. Revenge travel trend - During the pandemic, people stayed home and used their pools more. People are now making up for lost travel opportunities. Take a look at Royal Caribbean ( RCL ) for example. 15. Selling commodities - POOL sells commodity products. This is somewhat offset by a strong relationship between POOL and its customers. 16. High interest rates - In 2020, 2021 and into 2022, POOL benefitted from a low interest rate environment, leading to more home and pool construction. Rates are now quite high. 17. Low planned growth - POOL only plans to increase its sales centers by 2% this year. Positives As I mentioned earlier, POOL is not a weak or poorly managed company. There are a number of strengths or positives here. These are listed below: 1. Recurring revenues - About 60% of revenues are for maintenance and small repair. There is still some cyclicality with these revenues, as most pool costs are discretionary. 2. Global warming - Hotter weather usually results in more pool use. Also, hurricanes are increasing in size and number. That means more repairs and reconstruction. Florida is POOL's biggest market 3. Profit margin - The net profit margin was 10% or higher the past 3 years. That is quite high for a distributor. Actually, as high as I have seen. I attribute this to 2 factors. The first is, POOL appears to dominate its market. It has previously consolidated the market through acquisitions. The second is a strong relationship with customers, who are dealers and contractors. 4. Share repurchases - Two million shares were repurchased in the last 2 years. While this shows shareholder friendliness, I consider it a bad use of money with the high P/E ratio they had at the time. Most of those purchases were at prices well above today's. 5. Lower interest rates - Most economists expect the Fed to lower rates within the next year. Lower rates will make homes and pools more affordable. 6. Higher growth markets - POOL's largest markets are also some of the highest growth states. Their 4 largest markets are Texas, California, Arizona and Florida. Valuation For valuation purposes, I looked at larger publicly traded companies whose revenues primarily come from selling or servicing large leisure items. Value Line, Yahoo Finance, SEC Filings The peers included two pool or pool supply manufacturers; Latham ( SWIM ) and Hayward ( HAYW ), 3 boating stocks; Brunswick ( BC ), Malibu ( MBUU ) and Marine Max ( HZO ), and two RV manufacturers; Thor ( THO ) and Winnebago ( WGO ). Several things immediately stick out. Firstly, the analysts expect all but Marine Max to have declining sales over the two years ending in 2024. Marine Max would have been down quite a bit too without a large acquisition. The average decline is 10.5% per year over that period. All had surges after Covid and are coming back down now. Most had declines in 2023 after a peak year in 2022. This indicates they are driven by similar metrics as POOL. POOL's revenue decline was less than peers. However, the recent guidance drop indicates it may start catching up. All peers also had strong revenue growth from 2019 (the last pre-Covid year) through 2023. The 11% average annual revenue growth was well above historical growth rates. This indicates that the reversion to the mean has a ways to go. POOL's increase over that period was similar to the peer. POOL had a stronger profit margin than the peer, though it is relatively close if you take out Latham, which is currently running around breakeven. POOL has a similar leverage using the median of its peers. However, its two closest peers, Hayward and Latham, have negative tangible net worth. There is a huge difference in price to sales for POOL and its peers. POOL trades over 2.5X higher than its peers average by this measure. The same is true when it comes to P/E ratios, where POOL is about 2X the peer average. Both of these make POOL appear to be quite overvalued versus peers. The fly in the ointment appears to be Hayward. Hayward is a manufacturer of pool supplies and a supplier to POOL. Its price to sales is actually higher than POOL, though its P/E ratio is less. I attribute the higher price to sales to POOL's much better profit margin. Therefore, the P/E ratio is the better measure. Hayward also has higher leverage. The other swimming pool peer, Latham, trades at levels similar to the other peers. Based in part on that, I believe Hayward is also quite overvalued, and worth looking at as a short. Looking at the peer group as a whole, POOL is a slightly superior performing company. It has had a lower sales rate decline until recently. It also appears to have more recurring revenues, making it less cyclical. The peer average P/E ratio is 13.5X to 2024 estimated earnings. Since POOL is slightly superior, I believe it should trade at a P/E ratio of 16 to 2024 estimated earnings, which are $11.24 at the midpoint. That values the company at $180. Therefore, my one year price target is $180. The stock closed at $304.48 on July 8, 2024. Takeaway The market is not recognizing the continuing reversion to the mean of prospects for POOL. This was underscored by a large drop in earnings guidance by management two weeks ago. It is facing at least 17 headwinds. POOL's peers have already seen large share price declines. My price target of $180 assumes no recession. If there is one, POOL could go under $100. The biggest risk to shorting POOL is an acquisition. Another risk is a rapid decline in interest rates, enough to jumpstart the economy. This is a one-year timeframe recommendation. POOL has many strengths that should allow it to prosper, once many of its headwinds fade away. Analyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial short position in the shares of POOL either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.

    "text": "Money saving expert Martin Lewis has issued urgent advice for those struggling to pay their energy bills this winter. He urges those who are falling behind with payments to contact their supplier. Under rules by the energy regulator Ofgem , your energy supplier must come up with a proposal to suit you. On his MoneySavingExpert site he said: \"If you're falling behind with your energy bills, and finding yourself struggling to pay, the best thing to do is contact your supplier as soon as possible. Under rules from regulator Ofgem, your supplier has to help you – usually by negotiating a payment plan that you can afford.\" Suppliers could come up with a variety of suggestions if you are struggling to meet energy bills. They could arrange a full payment plan review, repayment plans or payment breaks. Other suggestions include reducing your payments or giving you more time to pay. They could also provide access to hardship funds. The assistance is decided depending on the particular case, and Martin said: \"Payment must be based on your ability to pay. So get in touch with your supplier as soon as possible.\" People using forced prepayment meters now have code which is part of suppliers' licence conditions and is legally enforceable. Rules which are included include: A ban on forcibly installing meters for vulnerable customers. This includes those 75 or over who have no support in their home or where they have a child under two. Households which need a continuous supply or health reasons, and exemptions for those with a physical or mental disability. Assessments should be made before force-fitting a prepayment meter in certain homes. They include households with children under five and those who are vulnerable because of pregnancy or bereavement. If an assessment determines you are likely to run out of credit because of being switched to prepay, the firm shouldn't proceed. 'Welfare visits' should also be made before prepayment meters. are installed whether yu are already on a smart credit meter and a switch is made remotely to prepayment mode. This also includes switches traditional meters for prepayment meters. There must also be 10 attempts to get in touch with you before a prepayment meter is installed. Companies must make contact over a three-month period to ensure you've had an opportunity to be home. Body cameras must be worn during visits to your property and when your prepayment meter is installed. Footage can then be audited to ensure they are complying with guidelines. Energy suppliers must provide other repayment options to enable you to clear debt before fitting a prepayment meter. A £30 top-up credit should be added to your meter if a prepayment meter is required to prevent households being left with no supply. Martin Lewis said prepayment meters should only be forced upon people as a 'last resort' to prevent disconnection. Energy suppliers, however, must explore all other options to recover the debt. After exhausting 'all options' they can remotely switch you to a smart prepay meter. If you don't have a smart meter, a court warrant will be needed by your energy supplier to force you to get a prepay meter.",

    "title": "Overstock.com is back from the dead",
    "text": "New York (CNN) — Overstock.com , which was one of the biggest names in e-commerce, is being revived just a year after its new owners ditched the name in favor of Bed Bath & Beyond. The relaunched Overstock.com sells a lot of stuff similar to its previous incarnation, including indoor and outdoor furniture, home improvement tools and jewelry, but with a bigger emphasis on closeout and liquidation deals. Its sister site will still use the Bed Bath & Beyond name and continue to operate with a refined focus on home goods and as a destination for registries for weddings and other life events. In June 2023, Overstock.com changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond after Overstock’s parent company bought the bankrupt retailer’s brand’s name and domain in a failed effort to benefit from its name recognition. A few months later, Overstock’s corporate name was changed to Beyond Inc. The changes didn’t catch on with shoppers, prompting major moves within the company’s management ranks. CNBC host and Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis was named Beyond Inc.’s executive chairman in February and said in an earnings call that getting rid of the Overstock name was a “fatal mistake.” Beyond Inc.’s attempt at new categories, like family room furniture and large area rugs, on Bed Bath & Beyond’s website failed to appeal to shoppers, prompting management to bring back the Overstock website. “Those results reaffirmed our conclusion during the quarter around the specific muscles that both brands can thrive separately while complementing each other,” Lemonis said in a May earnings call. In a more blunt assessment, Overstock’s integration with the Bed Bath & Beyond brand was “badly botched,” confused customers and sank sales, according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData. Bringing back Overstock creates a “more logical offer” for shoppers but will take time to resonate and reconnect with them, he said. “A lot of work is needed to grow Overstock and put the brand back on a stable footing,” he told CNN. “Before the merger, the brand suffered from poor awareness and declining relevancy, and these problems have not yet been fixed. In essence the brand is weak and has lost share to value-focused retailers like HomeGoods. ” The-CNN-Wire TM & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.

    "title": "Ford's Tale Of Struggles And Strategic Shifts",
    "text": "wellesenterprises Ford's ( NYSE: F ) 2Q24 earnings release was a complete debacle. The company reported losses of $1.1 billion in the Ford Model e segment due to lower sales and pricing pressures, which compromised the ability to dilute the high costs of production. The outlook for the whole year in this unit is projected to be a loss in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. On the bright side, more than offsetting these losses is the Ford Pro segment, which is estimated to generate EBIT in the range of $9 to $10 billion. Ford identified a difference between commercial customers' adoption of EVs and retail customers. The main difference is that commercial clients look at the total cost of ownership and choose the battery option that maximizes their use. There is a big difference between ICEs and EVs in terms of larger premium vehicles. Larger vehicles need bigger batteries , so the costs of production end up eroding the traditional margins from such vehicles. This has been a problem for traditional automakers trying to use the SUV playbook in the EV market. This resulted in a fantastic performance in the hybrid segment . That makes total sense once we realize that the larger EVs do not bring better margins and that customers are not ready to pay a huge premium on BEV vehicles compared to an ICE equivalent. For instance, hybrid trucks like the Maverick and F-150 have been stellar performers. All-in-all, the company has just acknowledged that it will only be launching vehicles that are financially viable, meaning that there were mistakes in the current line-up of products . Rethinking Business Organization Fortunately, for Ford, there is good news on other fronts that helped offset some of the bad results. The success of the company's software technology and services paid subscriptions has made the company eager to reorganize and try to emulate Tesla's success in software and services paid subscriptions. The results are interesting, with the company achieving double-digit revenue growth on 50%+ gross margins, according to the CEO in the earnings call . Another high-performing segment is the Ford Pro. This segment includes EV and ICE tailored to meet the needs of businesses, ranging from small to large corporations. In this segment, the company has observed that their blended offering of ICE and EV vehicles has been well-received by the market. The company will now be pushing for subscription services for telematics fleet management, which has been growing at 35% YoY. Financials Looking at the company's revenue estimates we can see that growth seems to be scant. That explains why the market reacted to the earnings release by dumping the stock. Seeking Alpha Basically, the problems in the Ford Model e segment are adding pressure to the margins at a time when revenue growth was already absent and the focus was on improving margins. This is basically telegraphing the market that things will take a lot longer to look better. YCharts The debt levels on the balance sheet are already high, however the trend seems stable. The current ratio is in line with the past and seems reasonable absent a global liquidity issue. YCharts Wrapping up, we can clearly see that the EV portfolio allocation has brought problems to the company. They designed interesting cars, like the Mach-e, but the ambition to drive change fast made them rush those cars into the market even at a loss. They discovered that the traditional thinking that volume will drive costs down and make the cars affordable might not apply here because volume growth has just evaporated. Acknowledging this was a good step in the right direction. Valuation In other pieces on the auto industry (you can check them here and here ), I have argued that the valuation for auto manufacturers is now divided into three buckets: EV native, Luxury, and traditional OEMs. Below you can see an illustration of this. Ferrari ( RACE ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) are pure luxury and EV plays, respectively. Porsche ( OTCPK:DRPRY ) and BYD ( OTCPK:BYDDY ) are more hybrid forms of this play and enjoy much lower multiples, but still higher than the traditional automakers like Stellantis ( STLA ), General Motors ( GM ), and Ford. YCharts It is very important to look at valuation from this perspective because from most other perspectives Ford will look like an obvious value play. Previously, I saw Ford taking the path to grab some EV premium due to their fast-pace of execution. Unfortunately, we have now realized that their fast pace got them into trouble. Seeking Alpha Conclusion I still think that Ford can carve a market share for itself if it learns from this turbulence. The secret is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater but to be more tactical with the moves that imply huge Capex. For me, it is evident that they have already derived some powerful insights. They should not go full-on EV, they should instead focus on their Ford Pro offerings where the EV portfolio has been well-received, and keep scaling their products there. Clearly, the commercial clients are figuring out better how they can take advantage of the EVs than the individual customers. Likely, the way to go for traditional automakers regarding non-commercial clients is not to make bravado commitments to fully electrify their fleets in a decade but to offer hybrid solutions that drive down emissions significantly in an urban setting, while not putting the clients at risk in longer distances. From the tone of the earnings call, I think the company has learned just that . If they execute the strategy to rebalance their offerings, I think later on they might get a sales multiple re-rating to a value closer to that earned by BYD. Using last year's revenue as a reference ($165 billion), that would value the company at $41.25 per share (diluted shares of 4 billion). However, there are many risks to the execution. As we have seen, Ford feared not being fast enough in the transition to EVs and ended up moving too fast. This is unchartered territory and many other traps lurk around. Ford will have to face many obstacles and tough choices before getting the market re-rating. Additionally, the company might have to overcome possible financial risks stemming from an economic downturn and/or tighter credit markets. In that sense, the current state of the balance sheet while not alarming, is not comforting in case we see another financial crisis. For all those reasons, I will keep an eye on the stock but will remain on the sidelines for now.

    "title": "Here’s all the income tax changes from today’s Budget",
    "text": "Finance Minister Jack Chambers and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe A range of tax changes and one-off measures announced in the Budget should leave most people better off. Finance Minister Jack Chambers said the changes to personal income taxes would support low and middle-income earners. The personal income tax package announced is worth €1.6b. The Government is increasing the main tax credits – the personal, employee and earned income credits – by €125 each. A tax credit is amount you offset against the tax you pay, or an amount you can earn before paying tax. This means the maximum employee tax credit for 2025 will be €2,000 for a single person. If you are married or in a civil partnership and both of you have PAYE income, you are both entitled to claim the employee tax credit. There is also a €2,000 increase in what is called the standard rate cut-off point. This means workers will be able to earn more before paying the top tax rate of 40pc. This is because what’s the standard rate cut-off point goes from €42,000 to €44,000. The Budget announcement saw an €150 increase in the home carer tax credit, an €150 increase in the single child carer credit, a €300 rise in the incapacitated child tax credit and a €300 increase in the blind person credit. And Mr Chambers reduced the Universal Social Charge (USC) middle rate from 4pc to 3pc. This applies to income between €25,000 and €70,000. The entry threshold to the new 3pc USC rate is being increased by €1,622 to €27,382, in line with the increase to the national minimum wage. This means that a full time worker on the minimum wage will see an increase in their net take home pay of approximately €1,424 on an annual basis. A single person earning €20,000 or less in 2025 will now be outside of the income tax net. The energy credits are being reduced to €250, a fraction of last year's giveaway of €450. Rent tax credit is increasing by €250, bringing it to €1,000 and €2,000 for a jointly assessed couple for 2025. Minister Chamber said that the credit for 2024 is being increased to €1,000 and €2,000 for a jointly assessed couple. Minister Chambers said that annual limit for the Small Benefit Exemption is increasing from €1,000 to €1,500. This is an amount of money or a gift your employer can give you tax free each year. He told the Dáil that he will permit five non-cash benefits to be granted by an employer in a single year under this exemption. “This means that workers may receive up to three additional tax-free rewards or gifts, for instance to reward exceptional performance, or mark significant life events,\" he said. The Minister said that there will be further increases to Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) thresholds, more often called inheritance tax.

Mortgage interest tax relief to continue to another year. This is worth up to €1,250 but really only applies to those who stuck with a tracker. Both the rent credit and the mortgage interest tax relief have a very low take up. The Department of Finance gave an example of a married couple with two children, aged 13 and 15. One works as a Garda and the other parent is a secondary school teacher. They both joined the public sector in 2006. They earn €61,000 and €66,000 per annum respectively, or €127,000 in total.

    "title": "Trinseo: Powerful Upside To A Distressed Situation",
    "text": "Baloncici/iStock via Getty Images Executive Summary Trinseo ( NYSE: TSE ) is a global plastic products' manufacturer spun out of Dow Chemical Company 15 years ago. The company's focus has gone from commodity feedstock to value added engineered materials and latex binders to various end users, like housing, automotive, medical, and consumer electronics companies. The current business environment has caused the company to lose sales and experience compressed margins. However, the company has recently seen an improvement and the business cycle looks to be on the up. The company is dealing with high debt, a legacy from the Bain Capital, LBO, and the Arkema and Aristech acquisitions. The focus now is on selling its JV, using proceeds to reduce the term loan, as well as retiring the bond, maturing in Sep 2025. This is achievable by improving profitability and cash flow, and with very low market capitalization one could see impressive share price improvement going forward. The fed cutting rates will help both the company's business and lower the interest rate on the debt which would results in improved cash flow. The market capitalization is only $115 million yet I believe it could increase to $500 - $1000 million or $14-$28/share with improving cash flow and these catalysts. Background and Ownership/Governance Trinseo is a global plastic manufacturer and was part of the Dow Chemical Company until 2010 when it was sold to the private equity firm Bain Capital for $1.63 billion. The company was listed on the NYSE and started to trade on June 12th, 2014, and eventually Bain sold all its stake. At the time, the company had $1.2 billion in debt from the 2010 Bain LBO. The business consisted of a few different segments from Dow and currently the company is segmented in engineered materials, latex binders, plastic solutions and polystyrene. The company bought the polymethyl methacrylates (PMMA) and activated methyl methacrylates (MMA) businesses from Arkema S.A in 2021 which are now part of the engineered materials segment for $1.36 billion (6.2x EBITDA). The company financed the purchase with $750 million term loan and the $450 million Sr Nts due 2029 plus then they sold its German synthetic rubber business for $491 million and cash proceeds of around $400 million were received at closing in 2022. The rationale for the acquisition was to provide the business with less cyclical, higher margin business and $50 million in annual synergies. Trinseo also acquired Aristech Surfaces LLC , an acrylic solutions business, the same year for $445 million or 7x EBITDA. This business is also a polymethyl methacrylates (PMMA) like the Arkema business. They recently closed two styrene plants and will therefore no longer report the feedstocks segment. in 2023, 21%, $570mm of the company's raw materials were purchased from Dow. In a JV with Chevron Phillips Chemical, the company owns 50% of American Styrenics LLC, a North American polystyrene producer. Previously, the company had attempted to sell their ownership, yet now the entire company is up for sale. After speaking to several market participants, it appears the business should be able to be sold for $800 million to $1 billion and $400 million to $500 million proceeds to Trinseo. Looking at the dividends the company received last year of $65 million ($400-$500 million / 65 =6.2-7.7x) this seems like a reasonable assumption. During the 2Q24 earning s call, the company's CEO stated: \"Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to give a brief update on the planned sale of our Americas Styrenics joint venture. The procedural steps defined under the exit provision of the joint venture agreement have progressed. Therefore, we have agreed with our partner, Chevron Phillips Chemical to pursue a joint sales process, which we expect to kick off this quarter. And in the ordinary course, should lead to a definitive agreement in the first half of 2025.\" The company has 35 million shares outstanding , and the largest shareholder is M&G Investment Management with 7.625 million shares representing a 21.7% ownership, and the second largest is Nut Tree Capital with 2 million shares which is a recent purchase and represents 5.7% ownership. The company had 49 million shares outstanding in 2015 and has slowly reduced shares outstanding. They bought back close to 3 million shares in 2022 for $151.9 million at ~$50/shares, which at the time was less than 10% of shares outstanding. Currently, that would buy back the entire market cap of $115 million. While the company's insiders own only 1.7% of the company, in August 2024, one of the directors of the board, Jeffrey Cote, bought shares on two occasions, 100k shares at $2.81 and 50.6k shares at $3.39. Shares outstanding (Company filings) The company has been led by the CEO, Frank Bozich since 2019. From 2013-2019, he was the CEO at SI Group, another specialty chemical company. David Stasse, became the CFO in 2019, previously having held the position of Treasure since 2013. The board led by K'Lynne Johnson, consists of 11 directors. K'Lynne, who's been on the board since 2017, previously held the positions of CEO and later became the Chairwoman of Elevance Renewable Sciences. Prior to that, she spent many years with BP (through the merger of Amoco). Frank Bozich, the CEO, is also a board member, while the rest of the directors have a lot of experience in either plastic/other commodity businesses or general corporate leadership. Business Focus And Segments The company manufactures various plastic products across 14 countries with 34 manufacturing plants including its 50% owned JV totalling 3400 employees. Headquartered in Wayne, PA, USA, the company also has four more regional corporate offices around the world. The company also operates 11 research and development facilities across the globe and spends around $50-$60 million a year on research and developments. Due to the R&D efforts the company has come up with new and improved products, often times at the request of its customers. The company has a leading market share in many of its markets and the end products go towards markets including, building and construction 22%, autos 19%, board and specialty paper 11% and appliances 9%. For the 2023 calendar year, the sales by region were as follows: Europe 53%, US 25% and Asia 19%. The current strategy is to be a specialty materials and sustainable manufacturer, which should lead the company towards products which are less cyclical, have higher growth and higher margins. The most recent acquisitions and divestiture/closures are a testament to this strategy, which was mentioned above. The company reports on four different segments, Engineered Materials, Latex Binders, Plastic Solutions and Polystyrene. They also have a JV with Chevron which is up for sale. The information on the different businesses is from the 10-K and summary is below. Trinseo Segments Stats (Company filings ) The engineered materials segment manufactures both rigid and soft plastics which are primarily used in applications in consumer electronics, medical, footwear, autos, and building and construction. These products are in higher growth areas and in general have higher margins. The segment also produces polymethyl methacrylates (PMMA) resins and sheets, which are primarily sold into building and construction, autos, medical and consumer goods. For the 2023 calendar year the sales by region were as follows: US 52%, Europe 34% and Asia 12%. The company is focusing on growing a sustainable product offering which currently represents 3% of the segment's sales yet is growing rapidly. The company's products are branded under several brands, like Emerge for consumer electronics and Calibre for the medical market. The PMMA products are sold under the brand name Plexiglas (when spelled Plexiglass that's referred to as the generic name for acrylic sheets) in the US and Altuglas in Europe and Asia. The soft products (TPE) are sold under several brands, like Megol, Apilon, Apigo and Apinat. The company's competitors in the rigid products space include, Sabic, Covestro, Styrolution, LG Chem and Kingfa while the company's competitors in the soft products space include Kraiburg, Celanese, Avient, Hexpol and BASF. The company's competitors in the PMMA space include Rohm, Plaskolite, Mitshubishi Chemicals and Schweiter Technologies. The latex binders segment produces styrene-butadiene latex (SB Latex) and styrene-accrylate latex (SA Latex). For the 2023 calendar year, the sales by region were as follows: 53% in the US and 38% in Europe. The company sells latex binders for magazines and other coated paper products, as well as being a large producer of carpet and artificial turf. SB latex allows for higher gloss levels and improved surface and water resistance. Another area for the company is in CASE applications which have higher growth and higher margins. CASE stands for coating, adhesives, sealants, and eslastomers and in general improves the appearance and the performance of the products in which they are used which is in a wide range of industries. The CASE products were 14% of sales in 2023 and have approximately 2x's higher margins than other products within this segment. The two main competitors are BASF Group and Synthomer Plc. The company is at the forefront of product technology in this business and half of the business is under contracts which allows for raw-material pass-through clauses. The plastic solutions segment products are made from a few compounds which are mostly sold in the automotive industry. 56% of the sales from this segment are products made from copolymers, which are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene-acrylonitrile resin (SAN). End usage for ABS products is mostly auto-related and the company developed mass ABS (mABS) and emulsion ABS (eABS). These products are sold under the Magnum brand and are licensed products due to the proprietary technology. The polycarbonate products (PC) are a substitute for glass as they are very durable while lighter and therefore are specifically good in autos and building and construction. The PC products consist of 9% of the plastic solutions segment. The company also makes blended compounds, which comprised 35% of sales for the segment in 2023. The Pulse brand is sold into the auto industry and the competition is as follows: Covestro AG, Saudi Basic Industries Corp, INEOS Styrolution, Versalis, Shanghai Kumho Sunny Plastics Co and a few others. The drivers of these products are the demand for lighter-weight products and the electric vehicle revolution. The Polystyrene segment, which has no sales in US but 65% of sales in Europe and 35% in Asia. The customer focus is those that utilize injection molding and thermoforming customers. The Styron brand is highly recognized, and the company has a long history and strong relationships with its customers. The company is offering general purpose polystyrenes (GPPS) and high-impact polystyrenes (HIPS). These products improve the look and the performance at a low cost across several industries, like appliances, packaging, which is including food packaging and disposables, consumer electronics and housing related materials. Fairly similar competitors as in some of the other segments, like INEOS Styrolution, Versalis, Total S.p.A, and Sinopec among others. This segment has more commodity-like aspects to it but the fact that the company has a long history and a thorough understanding of its customers' needs should help them. To summarize the segments, the first three are more value added to the customers and polystyrene is more commodity like. The company's focus has and will continue to move to more value-added products with higher growth potential and better margins/profitability. The company had a feedstock business, but it was shut down in 2022/23 and the company is no longer producing any feedstock, and the company will purchase all its styrene needs from third parties. Also, the two larger acquisitions the company made in 2021 turned the company from 10% specialized/value added products to now 30% , which will help margins going forward. Trinseo is also a 50% owner. The other owner is Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, of Americas Styrenics LLC which is the number one producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. The company supplied 18% of the NA capacity in 2023. The company received $65mm of cash dividends in 2023 and EBITDA was $62 million and in 2022 EBITDA was $102 million. The main competitors here are INEOS Styrolution, Total S.p.A and LyondellBasell. The business, as previously mentioned, is up for sale. Financial Performance The company has been public since 2014 , and Bain Capital and Dow Chemical sold out their remaining stakes in 2016. The company's recent performance since mid-2022 has been under pressure, but in the last couple of quarters we have seen a bit of a stabilization. Selected Financials 10 years with Sunshine Kapitals estimates (Company filings and Sunshine Kapitals estimates) The main reason for the downturn was the big upturn after the initial pandemic issues, with the western population getting flushed with cash from stimulus and low-interest rate environments. This sounds counterintuitive, but it created a lot of production and when the Federal Reserve and the ECB started to hike rates, the party stopped. Trinseo's customers cut back on buying and had to start destocking. The volume decline was big, and pricing declines followed. The cycle has now started to play through, and we have seen a volume pick up in the US, however not in Europe yet. Almost 40% of the company's products in 2021 went into housing and housing related items (22% building and construction, 12% appliances, 5% textile, which is carpets) which experienced this upswing and hard hit in the destocking period. The company also bought two companies at the peak and used debt which in 2023 needed to be refinanced at an expensive rate, therefore adding more cash cost to the business. However, as the fed is embarking on lowering rates starting soon, this will most likely both help the company's operations and lower the cost for the $1.1 billion variable interest debt. The fact the company has turned into a higher margin business will help with an even higher margin than before, when gross margins were in the low teens for several years. I estimate only 9% gross margin in 2025 and 11% in 2026 which seems conservative as the company just started to achieve better in the last quarter with 7.5% . Eventually, and perhaps earlier than I expect, the company's gross margins should hit the mid to high teens. Last quarter, 2Q24 , the company had sales of $920 million, which was down 4% year over year but up 2% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million vs $57 million year over year. This was the highest EBITDA since the second quarter of 2022 and the company did $112 million in EBITDA for the first half. The company is guiding that the next quarter will be a bit better, around $70 million plus, slightly lower in the fourth quarter. The company is tracking to adjusted EBITDA of around $250 million for 2024 with adjusted EBITDA of $153 million in 2023 and $311 million in 2022. However, net income is still negative and so far for the year the company reported negative free cash flow of $140 million. On the last earnings call, 2Q24, management stated that they will generate some cash in the second half of the year. The cash will mostly be freed up working capital, and it won't be enough to cover the total negative free cash flow for the year. But this indicates that the company has seen its low point in liquidity at $350 million. The total cash expenditure for 2024 is supposed to be $345 million but in that is $55 million of restructuring/turnaround costs. The company needs to generate above $300 million in EBITDA to be cash flow neutral, which at $67 million EBITDA (although adjusted, the non-adjusted in the second quarter was $64 million) is getting pretty close. The company has been under margin pressure due both to falling volume and pricing. Primarily due to falling demand in Europe. And Europe is larger part of sales, for instance in second quarter 2024 , Europe had $445 million in sales and the US had $264 million. The demand pickup hasn't happened in Europe yet, with volume down 9% in the quarter, but the weakness there is somewhat offset by a pickup in the US, volume up 11%, and in particular in the engineered materials segment. Reading from last earnings presentation, this is what the company stated. \"Continued to see positive momentum in Engineered Materials as moderating input costs, normalization of MMA market dynamics, and steady demand for downstream applications led to highest segment volumes and Adjusted EBITDA in two years.\" The worst performing segment in the latest quarter was the Polystyrene segment, which had $175 million in sales, down 21% year over year. The company has instituted a cost-saving plan which should help by providing $100 million per year, $50 million natural gas hedge and $50 million operational savings. The management commented on this in the latest earnings call and are confident on this number after shutting down two styrene plants which also had the natural gas hedges, both the general operating cost and the hedge are included in the $100 million number. The company is guiding for $65-$75 million EBITDA for the third quarter with decreasing styrene margins impacting Americas Styrenics otherwise similar environment vs the second quarter. The full-year guidance also assumes the same tough business environment. As mentioned before, the industry has been in a destocking period from the hangover after the covid related stimulus party. These cycles can be deep, but so can the upswing. The ordering of products initially could be very strong as most businesses have been destocking and most likely running the business on a low inventory level. With Europe being half of the sales and volumes still not doing better for the company, it could be useful to see a leading indicator like the German stock market (DAX) being up 16% over the last year. The expansion into more value-added businesses with higher margins, more growth and less cyclical should help too, although the timing of the two large acquisitions was not great and the debt is now expensive. According to 3Q23 earnings deck , the company was 90% commodity and 10% value added/specialized products in 2018 but now 70% commodity and 30% value added/specialized products. Balance Sheet As mentioned, the company was acquired from Dow Chemical in 2010 by the private equity firm Bain Capital, which are famous for using a significant amount of debt. After going public in 2014 the company had around $1.2 billion in total debt. However, after a few years of decent performance the company generated cash and despite buying back shares the net debt had decreased from $1 billion to $662 million. Then in 2021, following the acquisitions of Arkema and Aristech total debt was $2.3 billion and net debt $1.8 billion. These acquisitions probably top ticked valuations in the space as well. The company also decided to initiate an unfortunate buyback program and ended up executing on $150 million of share buybacks in 2022, when the share price was above $50/share. Recent poor cash generation and expensive refinancing has led to a distressed balance sheet with above $2.2 billion in net debt. See graph below. Net debt - total debt minus cash (company filings ) The capital structure needs to be addressed in 2025 despite a September 2023 refinancing of a term loan which was due in 2024. The financing raised was a $1.045 billion term loan due 2028, financed by Apollo, Angelo Gordon and Oaktree. The company used $385 million of proceeds to pay down a $500 million senior bond, which then left $115 million of notes outstanding which need to be paid down by Sep 2025. The company's potential proceeds from the JV are restricted assets for term lenders. The company is not in any covenant violations, and the only covenants are a minimum of $100 million liquidity, current liquidity is $350 million. The refinancing of the term loan came at a hefty price and currently the rate is 13.8% due to both high SOFR and spread. However, there is a partial payment-in-kind (PIK) option (to not pay all in cash interest) which is cash, SOFR+ 425 and the rest PIK at 525, for total interest of 14.8%. The company enabled the PIK option and can partial PIK for 24 months. The loan has been argued by some market participants to be a \"loan-to-own\" due to the firms involved. In my view, the company has time to turn it around. The senior notes are trading at distressed levels, albeit traded up in recent months. The 2025 notes are trading in the high 80s and the 2029 bonds in the low 40s. The market is clearly saying of the need for balance sheet restructuring, with bonds in the low 40s and market equity capitalization around $120 million. The balance sheet is upside-down at this point and there is a real risk of dilution. However, I do think there is a way out of this with recent better operational performance and the sale of the JV. The company, after paying down the $115mm 5.375% Senior Notes, has three years of runway with most of the debt due in 2028. The paydown of the term loan by $500 million would decease interest expense significantly, which would add to free cash flow. The company recently, in July 2024, received Accounts Receivable financing from KKR. This facility is for $150 million and due in 2028 and has no minimum liquidity requirements and the company is not restricted from using the facility to buy back the 2025 bonds, according to the credit agreement . $1.1 billion of the total debt is at a variable rate and with the fed most likely starting to cut rates, we could see lower interest expense going forward and a 100bps lower rate would be $11 million annual lower interest expense. Capital Structure Table (company fillings and Sunshine Kapital's estimates) In summary, the company has $2.2 billion in net debt and a stub bond of $115 million which matures in September 2025. The company has secured additional liquidity with the recent AR financing from KKR and has $350 million in liquidity. The company is guiding for an improvement in liquidity as they stated in the last earnings call the company will generate cash in 2H24. The liquidity can be further improved by the sale of the JV but is not anticipated to close until 1H25. The operations should be cash neutral in 2025 and with $350 million in liquidity the bond maturity of $115 million is manageable. The next debt maturity is then three years away, which gives the company plenty of time to improve EBITDA and cash flow to be able to refinance. Value Proposition The balance sheet is in distress and the bonds due in 2029 are trading in the 40s with a yield of close to 30%. The capital structure is \"top-heavy\" with large first lien debt, so there is risk of loss of principal on the bonds, but of course, if the business continues to improve and the company doesn't have a liquidity event, the bonds could be a great buy here. However, my view is that if it works, you might as well be in a stock with much larger upside. I can paint a scenario where in 2026 the company does more than $400 million in EBITDA and the multiple is normalized at 6-7x, which would mean the stock is worth $19-$30/share. The key is for the company to keep improving and start paying down debt with free cash flow. The cash charges, interest and capital expenditure, are around $300 million per year. However, with JV sale proceeds and pay down of ~$500 million in debt and lower SOFR with the fed cutting rates, the cash charges will go down significantly to perhaps around $230 million (interest and cap ex). This would lead to a run rate of $70 million to $170 million of free cash flow, with $300 million to $400 million in EBITDA in 2025 and 2026. EBITDA sensitivity (company fillings and Sunshine Kapital's estimates) Risks The biggest risk is that the operations don't turn around due to major recession and the company will continue to burn cash. The company is carrying a large amount of debt and it's expensive. Most of the debt is due in three years and the company will face refinancing risk. This could lead to either a restructuring in court or out of court, leading to significant losses for both debt holders and shareholders. The company's management team has been in place since before the downturn and was responsible for share buybacks at high share prices and increased amount of debt with acquisitions. They might not be the right team to embark on the turnaround. The JV sale might not occur, or sale proceeds might be much smaller than expected, which is around $400-$500 million. It might take longer than anticipated, current timeline is for it to close in 1H25. Catalysts The main catalyst for the stock is the operational turnaround, which seemingly has already started. The company needs to continue to come back from low volumes as the industry is done destocking and starting to buy products again. The rate environment has most likely peaked, and the company should fare well in a declining environment, with 2023 sales being 35% housing related . With the two acquisitions in 2021, the company is now in more business with better margins than before the downturn. The margin come back should be even better than before. The second catalyst is selling the JV and improving liquidity further and to pay down the bonds due in 2025. This will give them a good runway to debt maturities in 2028. The JV sale process is supposed to be concluded in the first half of 2025.

    "title": "\"If These People Had To Be Honest, It Would Be All Over...\"",
    "text": "Authored by James Howard Kunstler via Substack, \"If these people had to be honest, it would all be over.\" - Mike Benz “Now that our cheques are bouncing and we are starting to default on our debts, our entire civilization appears to be manifesting suicidal behavior in an effort to control the firing squad.” - Luke Dodson “Joe Biden” is feeling blue. Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that ! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump ... It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through the lens of America’s Woke-crypto-Marxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality? (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Halliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners. The blob couldn’t abide what Mr. Trump was proposing, so they turned around and burnt his ass with the Russia Russia Russia flamethrower. . . and after that there could be no more talk of friendship between the USA and Putin Putin Putin. Mr. Putin must marvel at how much America under “Joe Biden” is loving the old Soviet Union — since we’re doing everything possible to emulate its workings. We’ve got censorship. We’ve got an FBI-turned-KGB swatting citizens guilty of nothing and a DOJ stuffing them in our gulag. We’ve got a senile president every bit as non compos mentis as Konstantin Chernenko was. We’ve neatly managed to bankrupt ourselves. Do you see yet what has been going on in our country? In about fifty-odd days we are going to start correcting all that - if “Joe Biden” doesn’t conjure up nuclear Armageddon. This Thanksgiving, direct your prayers to averting that outcome, and give thanks for better days to come. * * * It’s that time of year! In this novella, a boy runs away from home in Manhattan all the way to Vermont the night before Christmas. Tribulations ensue. “A masterpiece of comedy and pathos.”",

    "title": "Nifty 50 Q1: Earnings per share growth may slow down to 10-15% in FY25. Here's why",
    "text": "Today, India is among the most valued stock markets in the world. India’s total Mcap is ₹ 450 trillion, the 4th largest in the dollar term, being valued at a Mcap/GDP ratio of 150% based on FY24 nominal GDP (current price) of ₹ 300 trillion (estimated). The nominal GDP is forecast to grow by 11% in FY25; hence, on a forward basis, the ratio will stand at 138%. Historically, India's average Mcap to GDP ratio has been 88%. Today we are quoting at 57% premium. Comparatively, developed regions like China and the Euro area have lower market cap to GDP ratios, ranging between 50% and 60%, suggesting that India's market is relatively expensive. A similar type of overappraisal valuation is visible in a few other countries, like the US, Taiwan, & Japan. These are valued at 200%, 300%, and 150%, respectively, based on CY24 GDP in USD terms. In that sense, we may be perceived as fair or cheap. However, these states’ economies are varied and not comparable to India’s. The US is the world's largest and most advanced economy, Taiwan is much smaller—about one-fifth the size of India—and heavily focused on the electronics sector, while Japan is recovering from decades of economic stagnation following the implementation of new reforms like Abenomics. The US & Taiwan are the countries believed to showcase fast growth & resilience, led by the strength of the economy. Taiwan has benefited significantly from the rise of the new economy, becoming a major supplier of electronics, semiconductors, and tech hardware, especially during periods of slower growth in China. Notably, TSMC, Taiwan's semiconductor giant, reported a 36% increase in second-quarter profits, reaching $7.6 billion, surpassing expectations. Similar advantages have emerged for other Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, driven by their resilient economies, export-oriented growth, digital economy, and supportive monetary policies, resulting in a favourable market cap to GDP ratio. Likewise, the US economy managed the COVID-19 crisis effectively, providing financial support to the public through cash dividends. Consumer spending and the job market have been strong. The rise of AI technology has benefit technology sector. Much of the growth in the US stock market has been driven by tech-based companies, which make up a significant portion of US stock market indices, thereby boosting overall market capitalization. In a nutshell, the valuation of all these countries is high because they were able to generate business when the world economy was transforming into a digital economy. And their domestic economic demand was also able to grow when the rest of the world experienced a slowdown. As these countries have the advantage of being early initiators, they should continue to trade at premium. However, believing that these high prices or valuations will be sustained is a task. Because these economies have been yielding benefit over the last 3-4yrs led by pent-up demand. If the initial buffer led demand slows, the degree of revenue or earnings growth would normalize, not supporting premium valuation. A slowdown in the world economy, which is feared next year, the US economy is forecast to go-slow from 2.3% in CY24 to 1.8% in CY25, could influence the stock market and peer country valuations. In India, the market has muted earnings forecasts for FY25, starting with the ongoing Q1 results. Nifty50 EPS growth is expected to slow from 23% in FY24 to 10 to 15% in FY25, which will determine the trend going forward. The author, Vinod Nair, is the head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide guidance for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking guidance regarding Adjusted EPS and Net Leverage Ratio is made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein and in alignment with the Company's financial covenants per the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

    "title": "The Mega Millions jackpot is over $1 billion again. Is this the new normal?",
    "text": "Remember this moment because it probably won’t last: A U.S. lottery jackpot is projected to soar above $1 billion, and that’s still a big deal. Friday’s Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $1.15 billion, evoking headlines and likely luring more people to convenience stores with dreams of private spacewalks above the earth. It doesn’t seem to matter that the nation’s top 10 jackpots — not including this one — already have boasted 10-figure payouts. For many of us, something stirs inside when a number ticks one dollar above $999,999,999. “The question lurking is, what happens when $1 billion becomes routine and people don’t care about it anymore?” said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of the 2022 book “For a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.” “There’s no easy round number after a billion,” Cohen said. “But also, how much money can one person possibly, possibly, possibly need?” Meanwhile, Mega Millions’ ticket prices will rise from $2 to $5 in April. The increase will be one of many changes that officials say will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts. Here’s brief history of lotteries and why jackpots are growing: Cohen notes in his book that lotteries have existed in one form or another for more than 4,000 years. In Rome, emperors and nobles held drawings at dinner parties and awarded prizes that ranged from terracotta vases to people who were enslaved. As early as the 1400s, lotteries were used in Europe to fund city defenses and other public works. Sweepstakes were common in the American colonies, helping to pay for the revolution against Britain. Cohen noted in his book that Thomas Jefferson approved of lotteries, writing that they were a tax “laid on the willing only.” Lotteries began to fall out of favor in the U.S. in the 1800s because of concerns over fraud, mismanagement and impacts on poor people. But starting in the 1960s, states began to legalize them to help address financial shortfalls without raising taxes. Feeling lucky? Friday’s Mega Millions drawing is worth an estimated $1.15 billion “Lotteries were seen as budgetary miracles, the chance for states to make revenue appear seemingly out of thin air,” Cohen wrote. When Mega Millions started in 1996, it was called “The Big Game” and involved only six states. It was meant to compete with Powerball, which then had 20 states and the District of Columbia. The original payout for The Big Game started at $5 million. The value would be nearly twice that today accounting for inflation. In 2024 dollars, the before-taxes prize could buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution or cover Michael Soroka’s $9 million contract to pitch next season for the Washington Nationals. By contrast, the pre-tax winnings from Friday’s Mega Millions prize could theoretically buy a Major League Baseball team. The Nationals would be too expensive. But Forbes recently valued the Miami Marlins at $1 billion. A better comparison might be Taylor Swift’s tour revenue at the end of 2023. Her Eras Tour became the first to earn more than $1 billion after selling more than 4 million tickets. Swift, however, was expected to bring in a total of more than $2 billion when her tour finally wrapped up Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar. These days, Mega Millions and its lottery compatriot Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico. In October, Mega Millions said it hoped increased ticket revenue and less stratospheric odds would lead to more people winning, even as prizes grow extraordinarily high. Games with massive payouts tend to be more popular despite the slimmer odds. Larger jackpots also attract more media attention, increase ticket sales and bring in new players, Cohen said. Lottery officials have allowed the odds to become lower with a larger pool of numbers to pick from, Cohen said. And that has made games harder to win, leading to payouts rolling over into even larger prizes. The first billion-dollar jackpot was in 2016. Cohen said he expects the upward trajectory to continue. Meanwhile, he warned against the tropes of the troubled or bankrupt lottery winner. A well-known example is Andrew “Jack” Whittaker Jr. He won a record Powerball jackpot after buying a single ticket in 2002 but quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks as he endured constant requests for money, leaving him unable to trust others. Most winners don’t turn out like him, Cohen said. “Even if we deny it, we all sort of believe in the meritocracy — this belief that if you won your money through luck, then you probably didn’t actually deserve it,” Cohen said. And yet various studies have shown “lottery winners are happier, healthier and wealthier than the rest of us.”",

    "text": "EasyJet hires rail freight exec as CFO ahead of leadership shake-up Jan De Raeymaeker joins as Kenton Jarvis prepares to take top job By Mike Sheen Updated: 09:55 BST, 14 October 2024 e-mail View comments Jan De Raeymaeker joins EasyJet as chief financial officer in January EasyJet has named Jan De Raeymaeker as its next chief financial officer ahead of a looming leadership reshuffle at Europe's second largest airline. De Raeymaeker, who current holds the same role at private rail freight operator Lineas, will join in January when his predecessor Kenton Jarvis is set to take on the job as chief executive. The executive, who will earn an annual salary of £550,000 before bonuses, previously led finance operation at Brussels Airways during a period of commercial repositioning. EasyJet char Stephen Hester said De Raeymaeker has 'good experience in the airline and transport sectors as well as strong continental European reference points'. Incoming boss Jarvis is set to replace Johan Lundgren next year, tasked with delivering full-year profits of £1billion by 2028-29 at the latest. Lundgren intends to stand down from his role at the beginning of 2025 following a turbulent seven-year stint marked indelibly by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Share this article Share Tough cross-border travel curbs earlier this decade caused considerable financial damage to the global airline industry, resulting in massive job losses and some air carriers going bankrupt. EasyJet shares have struggled for momentum this year, falling around 1.5 per cent, as geopolitical tensions drive concerns about the outlook for the cost of jet fuel and disruption to international travel. That is despite EasyJet telling investors in July it expected to post a r ecord-breaking summer this year as soaring demand drives higher profits, while rivals like Ryanair struggle by comparison. It sold 1.5 million more peak season seats than at the same time last year in the three months ending June, Jarvis said his replacement as CFO brings 'a deep knowledge of the transport and airline sector, which we believe will be of significant benefit to easyJet going forward'. He added: '[De Raeymaeker's] financial and commercial acumen will be critical as we continue to build towards the delivery of our medium term targets and our purpose of making low cost travel easy. I look forward to working closely with him.'

    "title": "SKF interim report Q3 2024: Solid margin and strong cash flow in weak markets",
    "text": "GOTHENBURG, Sweden , Oct. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Q3 2024 Net sales: SEK 23,692 million (25,771) Organic growth: −4.4% (−0.6%), driven by lower market demand across most regions and industries. Adjusted operating profit: SEK 2,821 million (2,956). Continued strong price/mix contribution, driven by pricing actions and active portfolio management, as well as good cost control which largely offset the lower volumes and currency headwind. Adjusted operating margin: 11.9% (11.5%) Net cash flow from operations: SEK 3,576 million (3,435) Rickard Gustafson , President and CEO: \" We are pleased to report a continued solid margin development, representing a year-over-year improvement, despite declining volumes in the prevailing weak market environment and significant currency headwinds. We continue our strategic execution creating an even stronger SKF, with the initiated separation of our Automotive business as a key component.\" Solid margin and strong cash flow The weak market conditions prevailed globally during the third quarter, which also was reflected in multiple leading external macro indicators. Our organic sales declined by -4.4%, driven in particular by a weak demand in China and within Automotive, especially towards the end of the quarter. On the other hand, our sales in India and within Aerospace were solid. Our adjusted operating margin, on the other hand, improved year-over-year and came in just shy of 12%, another proof point of our ability to better adapt to volatile market conditions. Our cost management and robust price/mix actions have effectively offset lower sales volumes, a significant negative currency impact and ongoing regionalization of our manufacturing footprint. We continue to work hard on cost out activities to mitigate potential short-term impact on our cost efficiency from the current lower volume environment. Our ability to uphold solid earnings also contributed to a strong cash flow from operations of SEK 3.6 billion . Unlocking value by separating the Automotive business The announced initiated separation of our Automotive segment follows our strategy to create a separate Automotive business. There is a strong strategic rationale for the separation since Industrial and Automotive are two business segments with different business logics. By establishing two fit-for-purpose independent companies, we expect to unlock long-term value and to accelerate profitable growth in both businesses. Since the announcement of the separation in mid-September, we have kick-started the separation planning and formed a dedicated project organization with the aim of listing the Automotive business in the first half of 2026. We intend to host a Capital Markets Day in Q4 2025 to share more information on the ambitions for both our Industrial and Automotive businesses. Strategic portfolio management to build a stronger SKF We continue to actively work with our portfolio to create a more focused and resilient SKF. I'm pleased that we have signed a contract to divest our ring and seal operation in Hanover , USA , which is a non-strategic asset for our Aerospace business, representing annual sales of approximately SEK 700 million , for a total value of approximately SEK 2.3 billion. Aerospace will remain one of our largest customer industries, representing total annual sales of approximately SEK 6 billion , corresponding to 9% of industrial net sales after the divestment. We will continue to invest and strengthen our position in core Aerospace segments related to the aeroengine and aerostructure bearing offers to optimize our business potential. With our strategy and decentralized operating model being well implemented, we are now in a position to also gradually accelerate profitable growth through smaller bolt-on acquisitions. As an example, the announced acquisition of John Sample Group is margin accretive and further strengthens our lubrication offering and position in the expansive India and Southeast Asia region. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their contributions to achieving solid margin and strong cash flow, despite the weak demand environment, and a continued high pace in our strategic execution. Outlook We expect to see continued market and geopolitical volatility, and the business is prepared to tackle different scenarios. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, year-over-year. For the full year, we expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, compared to 2023.\" Financial overview, MSEK unless otherwise stated Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Jan-Sep 2024 Jan-Sep 2023 Net sales 23,692 25,771 73,997 79,443 Organic growth, % −4.4 −0.6 −6.1 5.7 Adjusted operating profit 2,821 2,956 9,448 10,049 Adjusted operating margin, % 11.9 11.5 12.8 12.6 Operating profit 2,526 2,567 8,008 9,159 Operating margin, % 10.7 10.0 10.8 11.5 Adjusted profit before taxes 2,536 2,582 8,515 8,855 Profit before taxes 2,241 2,193 7,075 7,965 Net cash flow from operating activities 3,576 3,435 7,509 9,846 Basic earnings per share 3.40 3.64 10.91 12.67 Adjusted earnings per share 4.05 4.49 14.07 14.62 Net sales, change y-o-y, %, Q3 Organic 1) Structure Currency Total SKF Group −4.4 0.0 −3.6 −8.0 Industrial −4.6 0.0 −3.7 −8.3 Automotive −4.0 0.0 −3.5 −7.5 1) Price, mix and volume Net sales, change y-o-y, %, Jan-Sep 2024 Organic 1) Structure Currency Total SKF Group −6.1 0.0 −0.8 −6.9 Industrial −6.5 0.1 −0.9 −7.3 Automotive −5.1 0.0 −0.8 −5.9 1) Price, mix and volume Organic sales in local currencies, change y-o-y, %, Q3 Europe, Middle East & Africa The Americas China & Northeast Asia India & Southeast Asia SKF Group −5.2 −2.9 −8.7 2.9 Industrial - +/- --- + Automotive --- - +/- + Organic sales in local currencies, change y-o-y, %, Jan-Sep 2024 Europe, Middle East & Africa The Americas China & Northeast Asia India & Southeast Asia SKF Group −5.5 −6.1 −10.8 1.5 Industrial -- -- --- +/- Automotive --- -- +/- ++ Outlook and Guidance Outlook Q4 2024: We expect a mid-single-digit organic sales decline, year-over-year.

    "text": "Depleting Oil Reserves are Accelerating the Demand for Enhanced Oil Recovery 12-10-2024 01:57 PM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: Orion Market Research Enhanced Oil Recovery The global Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period (2024-2031). The market growth is driven by the rising global energy demand, owing to population expansion, industrialization, and urban development. Additionally, the rising concern of depleting conventional oil reserves is increasing reliance on EOR techniques to optimize production. Furthermore, technological advancements, stringent environmental regulations, and the demand for sustainable energy solutions are promoting the adoption of technologies that mitigate the environmental impact of oil extraction, driving market demand. The changing geopolitical landscape and fluctuations in oil prices are the macroeconomic factors contributing to market growth. Thus, the governments are actively focusing on enhanced oil recovery. Get Free Sample link @ https://www.omrglobal.com/request-sample/eor-market For instance, according to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, India, the Exploration and Production (E&P) sector offers investment opportunities worth $100 billion by 2030. India has 26 sedimentary basins, containing substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas yet to be fully tapped. Only 10% of the sedimentary basin area is under exploration, in 2024. The government is operational on the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Rounds to increase the exploration to 16%. Full report of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Market available @ https://www.omrglobal.com/industry-reports/eor-market Additionally, the government is focusing on promoting scientific data-driven exploration, by investing INR 7,500 crores ($900 million) in the acquisition of new seismic data, including that of the EEZ, financing stratigraphic wells, and acquiring aerial survey data for difficult terrains. The Government has additionally facilitated the ease of doing business in the E&P sector by consolidating and simplifying 37 approval processes into 18, with 9 processes now eligible for self-certification. According to the US CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery Survey, 2022, the incremental oil recovery from CO2 EOR in the US was around 245,000 bbl/d in 2022. It marked a decline of about 2% from the 2021 (250,000 bbl/d). A total of 1.9 MMcf/d of CO2 was supplied for CO2 EOR in 2022, including about 1.5 MMcf/d from natural sources and 0.4 MMcf/d from industrial sources. It was a decrease from 2021, which had a survey total of 2.0 MMcf/d. The supply from industrial sources, such as natural gas processing plants, nitrogen plants, and ammonia plants, decreased by about 200 MMcf/d from 2021 to 2022. However, the naturally sourced production increased by 100 MMcf/d during the same period. The major players in the UAV propulsion systems market include Baker Hughes Company, Cenovus Energy Inc., Chevron Corp., and China National Petroleum Corp., among others. The market players are contributing significantly to the market growth by the adoption of various business strategies, such as product development, mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and more. For instance, in May 2024, The Dow Chemical Company, the State of Wyoming, and the University of Wyoming launched The Wyoming Gas Injection Initiative (WGII). The program is designed to enhance oil well productivity and recovery from existing fields and wells in Wyoming. It incorporates advanced oil recovery methods, such as foam-assisted gas injection using recovered hydrocarbon gases, carbon dioxide, or other gases for the revitalization of oil fields, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by operations in Wyoming.

    "title": "NCLT approves Sarda Energy's resolution plan for SKS Power",
    "text": "The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved Sarda Energy and Mining’s (SEML) resolution plan for SKS Power Generation (Chhattisgarh), as part of the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. A formal order detailing the approval is still pending. The bench, comprising justices Anu Jagmohan Singh and Kishore Vemulapalli, ruled in favour of SEML, dismissing objections raised against the plan. \"We hereby approve the successful resolution applicant's (Sarda Energy) plan for the corporate debtor,\" the bench stated in its order. Read this | NCLT directs RBI, DIPP to expedite approvals for Hinduja’s takeover of Reliance Capital The process leading to this decision has been complex. In October 2023, after objections were raised, the NCLT remanded SEML's resolution plan to SKS Power Generation's lenders for reconsideration. This came after the resolution professional representing SKS Power had submitted the plan on behalf of Nagpur-based SEML, the successful resolution applicant. However, the plan faced a setback and was subsequently challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). In May 2024, the appellate tribunal overturned the NCLT's earlier decision, allowing SEML to seek final approval and directing the lenders to revisit the resolution plan. “Approval of a resolution plan under the IBC isn’t just a win for creditors and stakeholders, it is a powerful step towards revival , fostering a culture of second chances and sustainable growth,” said Akshat Khetan, founder, AU Corporate Advisory and Legal Services. SKS Power's insolvency proceedings began in April 2022, after lenders, including State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, approached the NCLT with claims totalling ₹ 1,890 crore. And this | Budget 2024: Govt announces measures to speed up insolvency resolution Several major conglomerates, including the Adani Group and Reliance Industries Ltd, had initially expressed interest in SKS Power but did not submit revised bids. Other bidders included NTPC, Jindal Power, Torrent Power, and Singapore-based Vantage Point Asset Management. SEML's successful bid, exceeding ₹ 2,000 crore, covers nearly all dues owed to the committee of creditors, who are grappling with the company’s insolvency.

    "title": "'Starter home' tax breaks, aid for first-time buyers: What to know about Harris' affordable housing proposals",
    "text": "Democratic U.S. presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, speaks at an Aug. 10 campaign rally in Las Vegas. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images Affordable housing is a cornerstone of the \"opportunity economy\" that Vice President Kamala Harris sketched out last week. Harris' economic policy pitch included proposals to lower the costs of owning and renting a home in the U.S. \"We should be making everything to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less,\" Harris said during her speech in Raleigh, N.C. More from Personal Finance: Trump and Harris both want no taxes on tips Vance wants a $5,000 child tax credit — but that could be difficult Here’s what a Kamala Harris administration could mean for your wallet The Democratic presidential nominee called for the construction of 3 million new housing units, both for rent and for sale, over the next four years — an initiative housing experts say would help improve affordability. That's \"the most exciting part of her plans to me,\" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. Supply is housing policy's 'bipartisan sweet spot' \"The bipartisan sweet spot around the housing affordability challenges that we have today is on increasing supply,\" said Dennis Shea, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy. Ever since the foreclosure crisis, a major period of property seizures in the U.S. between 2007 and 2010, there have been far fewer new single-family homes and multi-family rental buildings under construction, said Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a non-profit think tank in Washington, D.C. There's \"a more acute shortfall\" when it comes to affordable homes, she said, whether for renters looking for quality rental units or first-time buyers looking for their first home. watch now VIDEO 4:13 04:13 Housing prices rise despite more supply: Here's why Squawk Box To get to those 3 million new units, a Harris-Walz administration would introduce a \"first-ever tax incentive\" for home builders who build starter homes sold to first-time homebuyers, according to the proposals unveiled last week. The initiative would complement the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, according to the announcement. A bill pending in Congress called the Neighborhood Home Investment Act , which would promote the creation and rehab of starter homes for sale in distressed communities, would create that tax credit, said Shea. \"It would create this tax credit, and that has strong bipartisan support,\" he said. My conclusion is that [Harris'] housing plan would be worse than doing nothing. Edward Pinto senior fellow and codirector of the American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center Former President Donald Trump has also talked about ways to increase housing supply as part of his presidential campaign proposals. \"We're going to open up tracks of federal land for housing construction,\" Trump said in an Aug. 15 press conference. \"We desperately need housing for people who can't afford what's going on now.\" But Edward Pinto, senior fellow and codirector of the American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center, said it's \"much, much harder\" for the government to pass \"supply-side proposals,\" compared to efforts that generate demand by making homebuying easier for consumers. \"My conclusion is that [Harris'] housing plan would be worse than doing nothing,\" he said. 'It's hard to define what a starter home is' It will be important for Harris to clarify what she means by \"starter home,\" said James Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. \"It's hard to define what a starter home is,\" said Tobin, as underlying costs make it hard to keep building expenses low. \"In most markets in the country, it's hard to build to that first-time home buyer because of labor costs, land costs, borrowing costs for a builder, and then material cost,\" he said. watch now VIDEO 4:54 04:54 Harris economic plan will try to 'tell story' combating inflation criticism The Exchange Defining a range of price points for a starter home will also be important, as it may vary widely across different markets, said Tobin. \"In California, a starter home might cost seven or $800,000, but in the South ... it might only be $250,000 or $300,000,\" he said. The $40 billion innovation fund seems 'very high' The list of Harris' proposals also includes a $40 billion innovation fund. The money would empower local governments to fund local solutions to build housing, as well as support local solutions to build housing. Yet some experts are skeptical it will fulfill the intended goal. \"The federal government doesn't have a whole lot of authority over what happens at the local level,\" said Fairweather. \"It's up to the local planning commissions whether they're going to allow for more housing in order to get that [innovation fund] money.\" \"But time and time again, locals and local governments, local homeowners ignore incentives because they're so resistant to building more housing,\" said Fairweather. Additionally, the $40 billion housing innovation fund may be too high of a cost, making it unlikely to receive bipartisan support, said Shea: \"I don't know if the market could bear that price tag in Congress.\" Aid for first-time home buyers has less support Harris hopes to provide $25,000 down-payment assistance to first-time homebuyers who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for qualifying first-generation homeowners. The proposal stems from an idea the Biden-Harris administration presented earlier this year , which called on Congress to implement $25,000 in down-payment assistance exclusively for 400,000 first-generation buyers (or first-time buyers whose parents weren't homeowners) and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time buyers. Harris' blueprint would apply to all first-time buyers and broaden the reach to more than 4 million qualifying applicants over four years. But \"there's just not a lot of bipartisan support,\" said Shea. During an Aug. 16 appearance on Fox Business, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said Harris' $25,000 down payment assistance \"will only make the demand higher with the supply not moving, which means that prices will go up, fewer people are going to be able to afford it.\" \"And frankly, unless they're going to embed financial literacy in any program, it only means there will be a higher level of default,\" said Scott. To help renters, Harris addressed two pending pieces of legislation. The Democratic presidential nominee called on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act , a bill that calls for removing key tax benefits for those who own 50 or more single family properties. This initiative would curtail major investors from buying up large sums of single-family rental homes. Meanwhile, the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act would crack down on companies who use tools to fix market rent prices.",

    "title": "Economists have ‘really had it wrong' about recession, market strategist says",
    "text": "David Zervos, Jefferies' chief market strategist, and Barbara Doran, CEO of BD8 Capital Partners, weigh in on the likelihood of more rate cuts to come at CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit. If the first Trump administration is a guide, inflation is likely to be low. \"Take the tape, rewind it, put it back to 2019 and let's go from there,\" Zervos said. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by another quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting next week. > 24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are \"Two years ago ... 3 out of 4 economists were saying we're going into a recession,\" David Zervos, chief market strategist for Jefferies LLC, said during CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit on Tuesday. \"They've really had it wrong.\" The economy is still growing and inflation has come down, he said. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation stood at 2.3% in October, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy prices, according to the latest reading. Meanwhile, the fourth quarter is on track to post a 3.3% annualized growth rate for gross domestic product, the Atlanta Fed found. \"I think the market is spending way too much time focused on the inflationary consequences of either immigration or trade policies,\" Zervos said. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. 6 strategies to help mitigate rising car and home insurance costs Your money and the election: How to frame decision-making amid uncertainty Middle-class Americans want to know how the wealthy make money Money Report Trump promises ‘fully expedited' permits for investors of $1 billion-plus in U.S. Adidas's German headquarters raided in connection with tax investigation Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell praised the U.S. economy and said it provided cushion for policymakers to move slowly as they recalibrate policy. By most indicators, 2025 is going to continue in a positive direction, Barbara Doran, CEO of BD8 Capital Partners, said during the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit. \"Economic growth is going to be healthy next year,\" Doran said. \"The prognosis is good.\" Meanwhile, there is still the issue of President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy when he begins his second term. On one hand, \"we've got a lot of deregulation coming,\" Zervos said, which he called a \"huge disinflationary tailwind.\" \"Take the tape, rewind it, put it back to 2019 and let's go from there,\" Zervos said. In part because of such policies, during the last Trump administration \"we saw very little inflation,\" he said. \"We never really bounced out of that 2% range ... so I am really optimistic on the inflation side.\" However, questions remain on Trump's plans to issue punitive tariffs and whether that could stoke inflation once again. In November, Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, said in a note that the proposed tariffs would boost consumer prices by nearly 1% . \"It's still a big wildcard that we have to see,\" Doran said. \"It would be inflationary ultimately, but it would hurt the lowest income consumer, who is already hurting.\" If inflation does creep up as a result, that may delay more rate cuts after December's meeting, she added . Other experts also expect the Fed to slow down its pace of rate cuts in 2025.

    "title": "CVS Health to lay off nearly 3,000 workers in cost-cutting drive",
    "text": "LONDON — CVS Health is planning to cut about 2,900 jobs in an effort to slash costs, the U.S. health care company said Tuesday. “We’ve embarked on a multi-year initiative to deliver $2 billion in cost savings by reducing expenses and investing in technologies to enhance how we work,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The layoffs represent less than 1% of CVS Health’s ( CVS ) workforce. The CVS layoffs represent less than 1% of the company's workforce. “Impacted positions are primarily corporate roles. The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies and distribution centers,” the spokesperson added. The job cuts at the company, which runs a network of pharmacies across the United States among other businesses, add to the 5,000 or so layoffs disclosed last year. In 2021, CVS Health announced that it would close around 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. “Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures and evolving consumer needs and expectations,” the spokesperson said Tuesday. U.S. drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. At the same time, the front end of drug stores, where snacks and household staples are sold, has become less profitable as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart, Target and Costco. Dollar General’s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. CVS Health, which already uses artificial intelligence in some of its businesses, is making additional investments in the increasingly popular technology, as well as in robotics, “to further automate, reduce cost and improve the experience for all of its constituents,” according to its latest annual report . ___ Layoffs are down from a year ago, but job cuts across major U.S. employers and rising unemployment across nearly half of states are leaving Americans anxious and uncertain. Layoffs among major employers, including Google and Tesla, have driven the narrative. May layoffs were up 7% from the previous month and 8% from 2023. That represents about 123,000 more layoffs nationwide in May 2024 compared to the same time last year. Notably, 2023 saw a major spike in job losses, with about 2 million more layoffs than the previous year; these levels still remained far below pre-COVID levels, at 19.8 million layoffs in 2023 compared to 21.8 million in 2019. Despite layoffs in certain sectors, key indicators reflect a stable job market. The May layoff rate held steady at 1%, as did the national unemployment rate, at or below 4% ; both figures have remained constant since early 2022. On the job front, openings are still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Despite persistent inflation and high interest rates, many economists and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen agree that the U.S. economy is poised for a \"soft landing.\" This type of landing would be signaled by ongoing monthly job creation, moderate gross domestic product growth, and inflation finally hitting the Federal Reserve's 2% target—though the jobless rate may slowly rise. Americans are likely to remain fiscally wary, saving funds in case of a future downturn. Stacker used Bureau of Labor Statistics data to rank 19 major industries by the number of layoffs in May 2024 to see which industries have been most affected by new layoffs. The analysis uses seasonally adjusted data. Numbers for the month are preliminary and may be updated.

Worldwide, as economies shift toward clean energy, analysts expect more than 400,000 mining workers to be laid off by 2035 —largely in China and India, but also in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. logging jobs are also projected to decline over the next decade as the industry adopts more advanced machinery and demand decreases for logging, particularly as tech advancements replace the need for virgin paper products. - May 2024 layoffs: 7,000 --- Change from prior month: No change --- Change from May 2023: -1,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 0.2% (Rank: #19) --- Change from prior month: No change --- Change from May 2023: -0.1 percentage points Congress set the federal budget six months late this year.

Executives cited recession concerns, efficiency, and artificial intelligence as drivers for these layoffs. Google has more layoffs coming this year, as do other major tech leaders. Many of these companies sit at the intersection of tech and media, which is another large segment of the information industry.

This field has struggled to attract and retain teachers over the last decade as public school funding has dried up. Record inflation has made teaching wages close to unlivable in some places as conservative elected officials have slashed public education funding. Public schools may be forced to cut teachers if costs rise to unmanageable levels. - May 2024 layoffs: 42,000 --- Change from prior month: +1,000 --- Change from May 2023: +8,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 0.6% (Rank: #14) --- Change from prior month: No change --- Change from May 2023: +0.1 percentage points Finance and insurance companies enjoyed an employment boom in recent years, spurred by the onset of the pandemic. Americans cooped up in their apartments and houses leaped at the chance to secure larger homes for themselves at historically low interest rates. In today's high-interest rate environment, these firms may find themselves poorly equipped to keep all their workers on payroll. Industry giants resorted to sizable layoffs in 2023, with Citigroup following suit this year. - May 2024 layoffs: 49,000 --- Change from prior month: -3,000 --- Change from May 2023: -11,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 1.0% (Rank: #8) --- Change from prior month: -0.1 percentage points --- Change from May 2023: -0.2 percentage points The phrase \"nondurable goods\" refers to any item consumers can purchase that will go bad if left on a shelf for too long or will only provide the consumer with a single use before it's gone. These items include food and cleaning products, as well as cigarettes. Employers in the food production industry, in particular, are laying off workers in higher numbers than in recent history . Automation, labor costs, climate change, and immigration policies are all factors affecting the industry.

These can be plastic storage bins, children's toys, and even technology like smartphones. Manufacturing of durable goods saw a boom in the first two years of the pandemic as consumers spent their incomes on things they could safely enjoy from their homes. Some of those manufacturers have had to scale back head counts as consumer demand has dropped off in the goods-producing sector and moved into services—and as inflation has limited consumers' spending power. - May 2024 layoffs: 73,000 --- Change from prior month: +5,000 --- Change from May 2023: +13,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 2.7% (Rank: #1) --- Change from prior month: +0.1 percentage points --- Change from May 2023: +0.3 percentage points The arts and entertainment sector faced new challenges last year. TV and movie writers were on strike for nearly five months over pay and other issues, and actors walked out, too. While new contracts have resolved both strikes, Hollywood remains tumultuous as the streaming economy challenges the entertainment sector. Pixar, Amazon Prime Video, and Universal Music Group have been among the entertainment companies that cut jobs in 2024. - May 2024 layoffs: 113,000 --- Change from prior month: +11,000 --- Change from May 2023: +20,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 1.6% (Rank: #4) --- Change from prior month: +0.2 percentage points --- Change from May 2023: +0.3 percentage points The transportation, warehousing, and utilities industry encompasses the massive supply chain in the U.S., which experienced unending hiccups and shocks throughout the last several years. The pandemic pushed the supply chain to ramp up, and more recently, it's over capacity with lower demand levels . Now, trucking, flight, and other companies built around moving freight are going bankrupt or shuttering operations, and their employees are finding themselves out of a job. UPS is the latest major player to announce a massive sweep of layoffs this year. - May 2024 layoffs: 122,000 --- Change from prior month: -6,000 --- Change from May 2023: -101,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 0.8% (Rank: #12) --- Change from prior month: No change --- Change from May 2023: -0.6 percentage points Retail trade is one of the largest employers in the country, including retail floor workers as well as those employed within the many corporate branches at retail giants like Target and Kroger. Inflation has tightened wallets, limiting individuals' spending and leaving retail establishments to feel the initial impacts. In 2023, retail giants, including Walmart and Nordstrom, announced cuts to their workforces—largely among corporate employees. Those layoffs have continued in 2024 at companies like Nike, REI, Macy's, and Wayfair.

Residential and commercial construction bear the brunt of the slowdown as fewer individuals are in a place to buy homes, and not as many companies can afford to revamp or expand offices and storefronts. This is in stark contrast to 2021 when record-low interest rates created a surge in demand for real estate. - May 2024 layoffs: 179,000 --- Change from prior month: +17,000 --- Change from May 2023: +10,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 1.3% (Rank: #5) --- Change from prior month: +0.2 percentage points --- Change from May 2023: +0.1 percentage points The accommodation and food services industry comprises hotels, restaurants, and fast-food chains that employ tens of millions of Americans. These leisure services have largely recovered from COVID-era struggles, though record inflation has tempered some of that recovery. Higher costs of essential expenses mean there is less left over for Americans to treat themselves by dining out or taking a trip. Inflation at restaurants is higher than that of groceries , and in many establishments, technology is taking orders and replacing cashiers. - May 2024 layoffs: 425,000 --- Change from prior month: +71,000 --- Change from May 2023: +138,000 - May 2024 layoff rate: 1.8% (Rank: #2) --- Change from prior month: +0.3 percentage points --- Change from May 2023: +0.5 percentage points The professional and business services industry includes attorneys, marketing, accountants, and other professionals who support businesses in mostly white-collar positions. Many of these positions have been safe over the past three years as demand from consumers remained hot and companies seemingly couldn't find enough workers to fill jobs. But interest-rate hikes, bank failures, and challenges among other industries serviced by these professionals spell trouble. Tech companies' current struggles, for example, trickle down to business services as firms cut costs. - June 2024 layoffs: 5,000 --- Change from prior month: -2,000 --- Change from June 2023: -3,000 - June 2024 layoff rate: 0.2% (Rank: #19) --- Change from prior month: No change --- Change from June 2023: -0.1 percentage points Congress set the federal budget six months late this year.

These leisure services have largely recovered from COVID-era struggles, though record inflation has tempered some of that recovery. Higher costs of essential expenses mean there is less left over for Americans to treat themselves by dining out or taking a trip. Inflation at restaurants is higher than that of groceries , and in many establishments, technology is taking orders and replacing cashiers. - June 2024 layoffs: 133,000 --- Change from prior month: -17,000 --- Change from June 2023: +12,000 - June 2024 layoff rate: 1.6% (Rank: #3) --- Change from prior month: -0.2 percentage points --- Change from June 2023: +0.1 percentage points The high interest rates the Fed implemented to stunt inflation slowed the greater real estate market and, by extension, construction. Residential and commercial construction bear the brunt of the slowdown as fewer individuals are in a place to buy homes, and not as many companies can afford to revamp or expand offices and storefronts.

Inflation has tightened wallets, limiting individuals' spending and leaving retail establishments to feel the initial impacts.

    "title": "Yields rise as equities sell off heading in to New Year",
    "text": "(Updates with midsession trading) By Matt Tracy Dec 27 (Reuters) - The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield rose on Friday as equities sold off in an otherwise quiet holiday-shortened week, as investors look to unemployment figures next week for signs of the economy's path in the New Year. Yields were little changed following the release of business inventory data that fell in line with Reuters polling. Retailers' inventories ticked up in November by 0.3% to $827.5 billion from $825.4 billion the previous month, U.S. Census data on Friday showed. Wholesalers' stocks declined 0.2% to $901.6 billion from $903.8 billion in October. Another factor in Treasury trading on Friday was a selloff in U.S. equities, according to Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for global fixed income at asset manager Brandywine Global Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index was last down 1.13% on the day, while the S&P 500 was down 1.53%. \"It represents a potential wealth transfer effect,\" McIntyre said. \"That could change people’s outlook on the economy.\" A more pessimistic economic outlook could in turn impact appetite for Treasuries, he added. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note ticked up 1.2 bps from late Thursday to 4.596%. It hit 4.641% on Thursday, the highest level since May 2, before moderating after a strong seven-year note auction in the afternoon. The two-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was last down 1.9 bps from late on Thursday at 4.311%. It had reached 4.341% in early morning trading. The 30-year bond yield rose 4.3 basis points to 4.806% from late trading on Thursday. Tax positioning by investors was likely one factor behind the equities selloff, and could also influence Treasuries trading heading in to the new year, according to Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors. \"The market is thin and volatile,\" Doty said. \"I see both (equities and bonds) disturbed by tax season.\" The closely watched gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, considered a gauge of growth expectations, was at a positive 29.7 bps, up slightly from 27.1 on Thursday. Based on the Fed funds futures term structure, traders see minimal chance that the Fed will ease at its January meeting, after delivering its third rate cut earlier this month since the central bank became more accommodative in September. The implied breakeven inflation rate on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) fell to 2.347% from 2.362% late on Thursday, indicating the market sees inflation averaging just under 2.35% a year for the next decade. According to LSEG data, traders do not see another interest rate reduction until May and see a less than 50-50 chance of another 25 basis points from there by year end. Next week's data releases include pending home sales figures for November on Dec. 30 and the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for last month on Dec. 31. The latest initial jobless claims data will follow on Jan. 2 after the New Year's holiday. (Reporting by Matt Tracy in Washington; Editing by Aurora Ellis and Matthew Lewis)",

    "title": "Milton insured damage projections are in: it starts at $30 to $50 billion",
    "text": "With Hurricane Milton — finally — here and gone, the question for many in the business community across the region is simple, with a sort of complicated answer: outside the human toll, what will Milton cost? One report, from Fitch Ratings, estimates Milton losses will range from $30 to $50 billion, which puts it around the total cost of Hurricane Ian in 2022, which made U.S. landfall in Lee County and caused $54 billion in losses. That would make it a top three hurricane in the U.S. in total losses, trailing Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused $65 million in damage, or $101.86 million in 2023 dollars, according to the Insurance Information Institute. While $50 billion is obviously a big number, analysts at Morningstar DBRS say if Milton made landfall in more densely populated Tampa, rather than where it did, on Siesta Key, the total costs would have ranged from more like $60 billion to $100 billion. Or even higher. Analysts at Jefferies, according to a report from Business Insurance, estimate a mid-double-digit billion dollar insured loss would follow a major hurricane impact in one of Florida’s most heavily populated regions. “A 1-in-100 year event is estimated by some to result in $175 billion in losses for landfall in the Tampa region, and $70 billion in losses in the Fort Myers region,” Jefferies analysts say, according to Business Insurance. Florida insurance market share, 2023; commercial lines SOURCE: Fitch Ratings Even the lower Fitch $50 million figure is subject to go higher. Ultimate losses, Fitch projects in its note, “will also depend on demand surge, as Milton follows closely on the heels of Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 that devastated the Southeast U.S. two weeks earlier. Higher demand and limited supply of labor and materials needed to adjust claims and repair/rebuild following multiple large-scale disasters can increase insured losses by 20% or more.” Beyond the costs merely for Milton, there are other factors at play for the Florida insurance market. Consider these ominous projections from the Oct. 10 Fitch report: The analysts add that the “heightened level of catastrophe losses likely limits any potential for rate declines in property catastrophe business in 2025 as (re)insurers maintain underwriting discipline.” In other words: Florida insurance rates, which in some places were stabilizing after massive increases, are likely to go up. Again. An Oct. 9 commentary from A.M. Best backs up that point, particularly in reinsurance. “After a relatively calm renewal season in 2024 — especially compared with the far more tense January 2023 renewal season, which was marked by rate increases, higher retentions demanded of primary insurers and constrained capacity — Hurricane Milton,” the report states, “will likely stall any softening of price and terms in the property reinsurance market.” The A.M. Best report projects that the Florida insurance market, after absorbing Milton into pricing models, could then be staring at another issue: capacity. “The hard reinsurance market, possible local insolvencies and declining capital among insurers concentrated in Florida will significantly pressure the Florida property market,” the commentary states. “Citizens Property Insurance Corp. has been making concerted efforts to depopulate its book. However, any cutback in capacity among other insurers will only add to the number of property owners covered by Citizens.” Florida insurance market share, 2023; personal lines SOURCE: Fitch Ratings",

    "title": "Xi Jinping will be desperate not to repeat his mistake from a decade ago",
    "text": "In the middle of this month, China’s Communist Party leaders, military leaders, provincial heads and academics will gather to map out the country’s long term economic strategies. Expectations for major changes are low. The “third plenum,” one of seven meetings held between the party’s five-yearly Congresses (the other six are mainly concerned with personnel and internal party issues), will outline the party leadership’s economic plans and goals for the next decade. Xi Jinping is desperate to stimulate China’s stuttering economy. Credit: AP Previous third plenums have resulted in massive reforms. In 1978 Deng Xiaoping set in train the transformation of China’s economy by opening it to the world while, in 1993, Jiang Zemin laid the foundations for a more market-oriented economy, with the plenum deciding that the market would take the decisive role in allocating resources and that state-owned companies would be allowed to go bankrupt. While it is likely that the plenum will produce plans to tackle some of the challenges confronting the economy, it is improbable that there will be major changes of direction given that, for the past decade, China’s economic policies have been directed by Xi Jinping . The gathering is being held far later than normal, given that the third plenum is usually convened a year after the party’s five-yearly congress and was therefore expected to occur in October or November last year. No explanation has been given for the delay, although the number and complexity of the challenges China faces might have something to do with it. The party’s leadership in the Politburo provided a hint of the meeting’s agenda late last month, saying it would seek endorsement of a “resolution on comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.” Xi has been outlining his own vision for the economy in speeches where he has focused on (and devoted massive amounts of government funding) to what he has called “high quality” development, or technologies like semiconductors, artificial intelligence, robots, advanced manufacturing, big data and “green technologies” seen as the key to geo-economic leadership over the next several decades at least. These new quality productive forces, as he has described them, involve “advanced productivity freed from traditional economic growth models.” It is expected there will also be a whole-of-state effort, directed by Beijing, to both respond to “bottleneck technologies,” like advanced computer chips, where the West, and the US in particular, have significant leads over China, while leapfrogging the US and dominating other key emerging technologies. The plenum might do more to help restore activity to the property sector, a prerequisite for rebuilding consumer confidence and spending. Credit: Getty China is confronting a number of problems that the plenum will also have to address. Xi’s crackdown on property developers and the big technology companies in 2021 dealt massive blows to China’s private sector and to its consumers. The property sector plunged into a downward spiral, with developers collapsing and sales and prices falling continuously, although very recently there have been some tentative signs that a range of government policies to try to stabilise the sector might be having some effect. The listed private technology sector had around $3 trillion wiped off its market capitalisation as a result of the crackdown. As a result of the actions against the property and tech companies, where private companies represented about 55 per cent of the value all Chinese listed entities in 2021, at the end of last year they represented only about 35 per cent. That’s reflective of the broader trends within the economy. Private enterprises, which had generated a disproportionate share of China’s growth – a decade ago they generated about 60 per cent of the growth – now, after Beijing has poured resources into state-owned or controlled enterprises in pursuit of Beijing’s fused economic and military industry strategies and has tightened the party’s control over private businesses -- provide less than half. While China has said it now wants to treat private entities equally with state-owned entities, the private sector’s confidence and willingness to invest has been undermined by the events of the past three years. So too has – despite a concerted attempt by China’s leadership to drum up foreign investment – the confidence of foreign investors. Last year, for the first time in a decade, there was a net outflow of foreign investment. China’s deteriorating trade relationships with its biggest market in the West – the US and Europe – aren’t helping and represent a threat to Xi’s strategies. China’s emphasis on an expansion of manufacturing and exports to offset weak domestic demand has run into tariff walls in the US and, it appears probable, Europe because of the threat of excess capacity in Chinese factories to their domestic industries. The US and its allies are also restricting China’s access to some of the building blocks of advanced technologies, like the newest generations of semiconductors and the machinery to make them. Domestic consumption, perhaps because of the wealth shock created by the implosion of the property sector, has remained weak and, so far, Beijing’s efforts to stimulate it have been modest. China is confronting a number of problems that the plenum will have to address. The property sector woes have also exposed vertical fiscal imbalances within the economy. Beijing raises most of the revenue while local governments do most of the spending. That has made the local governments reliant on land sales and high levels of off-balance-sheet funding to fund their operations, with the deep downturn in property leaving many local governments at financial breaking point. The plenum will inevitably have to do something to reform that mismatched relationship between revenue and expenditures and bail out the most affected local governments. It might also do more to help restore activity to the property sector, a prerequisite for rebuilding consumer confidence and spending. It is unlikely that anything particularly bold will be announced at the plenum. Xi’s shift from the previous prioritisation of growth towards national security and geopolitical dominance isn’t going to be undone. It is also unlikely that the plenum will provide much detail on its plans for challenging the US in the advanced technologies that will determine future geo-economic and geopolitical leadership. It was Xi’s detailed “Made in China 2025′′ plan released a decade ago that first alerted the rest of the world to his economic ambition of government-driven and incentivised domination of key 21st Century technologies and through that dominance, geopolitical leadership. That ignited the backlash to the export drive towards that dominance that has seen barriers to China’s trade rising steadily in the West. It is improbable that he will make the same mistake.

Clouse said it's a misconception that Rao's $8-$9 canned sauce is \"super premium\" and only for \"high-income households.\" \"If you want a high-quality-rate Italian dinner at home and you're going to order — let's call it mediocre Italian food on Doordash ... you're gonna pay $30-$40. That leaves you a tremendous value to pay $8 or $9 for a jar of pasta sauce,\" Clouse said. As consumers seek lower prices, there's growth in dry pasta, soup, and pizzas as well. In Campbell's fiscal 2024 Q4, sales increased 11% year over year to $2.3 billion, while adjusted earnings per share jumped 26% to $0.63. Its overall volume mix is up 1%, led by a 2% increase for meals and beverages, while its snacks segment stayed flat. Clouse said consumers are \"coming back to categories that they might have taken a hiatus from because they just had to make tougher choices\" as persist. The company expects net sales to grow between 9% and 11% for fiscal year 2025. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman reiterated an Overweight rating on shares, highlighting that while Clouse has been optimistic about shoppers returning to normal behavior, much of the optimism isn't baked into the guidance for meals and beverages. \"Should the consumer environment improve, therefore, it may help soup volumes more than anticipated,\" Goldman said. Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris administration has been cracking down on food costs, with Harris now laying out bigger plans for the White House including a federal ban on price gouging. Per the cost of living plan laid out by the Harris campaign, within Vice President Harris and Governor Walz's first 100 days, they plan to work with Congress to: Advance the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. Set clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can’t unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive profits on food and groceries. Secure new authority for the FTC and state attorneys general to investigate and impose strict new penalties on companies that break the rules. When Yahoo Finance asked for his take on the potential bills, Clouse said he's ready to \"navigate all worlds\" from a policy standpoint. \"There is never a day we're not starting with the consumer first and trying to figure out how do we do the right things and be appropriately thoughtful about what they're dealing with,\" said Clouse. \"Our balancing act here has been to be appropriately priced where it's justified, but then to also weigh affordability and value.\" \"We don't win if consumers don't find us affordable and a great value,\" he added. —",

    "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Could Skyrocket in the Back Half of 2024 and Beyond",
    "text": "Lululemon Athletica ( LULU -1.72% ) and Celsius Holdings ( CELH -2.75% ) are two consumer brands that have become wildly popular over the years. Both stocks have been on great runs the past several years, although both have had large sell-offs this year. Let's look at why these stocks have sold off and why they could both be poised to see major rebounds in the second half of this year and beyond. 1. Celsius Holdings Energy drink maker Celsius had been on a massive run the past five years, until about late May. Now the beverage stock suddenly finds its share price cut nearly in half from its all-time highs. The company's success stems from carving out an attractive niche in the energy drink market by appealing to customers with a less aggressive aesthetic: differentiated flavors such as Peach Vibe, no-sugar options in a high-sugar category, slimmed-down cans, and a toned-down marketing message. A distribution deal with PepsiCo in 2022, meanwhile, gained the company widespread distribution across retailers, especially in the important convenience store channel. However, after three consecutive years of 100% or more revenue growth, that growth has unsurprisingly begun to slow. The company is now essentially fully distributed in the U.S. First-quarter revenue growth of 37% was strong, but ultimately a huge deceleration from the 95% sales growth it was in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Nielsen data in tracked channels has shown growth continuing to slow week after week, down to 13% the last week of June, although the comparison was affected by the timing of the July 4 holiday. Despite its slowing growth in tracked channels, Celsius still has a number of opportunities in front of it that could help the stock rebound this year and beyond. International growth remains a big opportunity for the company. It's just barely scratching the service in terms of penetration, as it has just entered markets in the U.K. and Australia. It also has an opportunity for increasing items per store, better cooler placement, and growing in non-tracked channels. Trading at under 35 times 2025 earnings estimates and with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1 times, the stock looks attractively valued for a growth stock that still has a number of good opportunities ahead of it. If the company can expand internationally and gain a similar niche to what it has in the U.S., the stock should perform well over the long term. CELH PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. 2. Lululemon Athletica Lululemon's stock has had a difficult year, with shares down over 40% year to date. Investors have been nervous about increased competition from the likes of upstarts such as Alo and Vuori, as well as potential fashion shifts. Cautious commentary about the U.S. consumer in March when it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results, combined with its chief product officer leaving in May, only added fuel to the fire. Last quarter, the company saw flat U.S. same-store sales , but a 29% jump in international same-store sales led to a 7% overall increase in same-store sales and a 10% overall increase in revenue. International remains one of the biggest opportunities for Lululemon moving forward, and so far it appears the brand is resonating with international customers. However, the company also has the ability to reinvigorate growth in its North American markets through product innovation and category expansion. The brand appears to remain strong, and the potential of an improved U.S. consumer and strong back-to-school season could also bode well for growth. Early indications are that the back-to-school shopping season is off to a good start, with Adobe Analysts noting that Amazon saw its Prime Day revenue for kids' apparel soar 165%, while other back-to-school items like backpacks and school supplies were up 216%. Other data points from the National Federation of Retailers, including May containership volumes and strong June retail, also point to a strengthening retail environment. At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 18 based on 2025 estimates, Lululemon is trading at one of the cheapest valuations in its history. LULU PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts. Given its valuation, the opportunities in front of it, and the potential for a strong back-to-school shopping season, the apparel stock could be set up to see a strong rebound in the back half of this year and beyond.",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia Turns to Debt Markets for Vision 2030 Financing",
    "text": "A month ago, Saudi Arabia raised $3 billion from a fresh bond sale via its state oil major Aramco—the second for the kingdom since July—in response to lower oil prices. That latest bond has pushed Saudi’s total bond issuance this year to some $50 billion; Vision 2030 is a costly diversification project. Bloomberg reported on the total size of Saudi Arabia’s exposure to bond markets via its sovereign wealth fund this week. According to data compiled by Bloomberg writers, the Private Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had issued a total of $50 billion in bonds this year, in both corporate and sovereign debt. It is also likely to issue more debt by the end of the year as it becomes one of the largest bond market players internationally. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} It’s all because of the Vision 2030 program. A brainchild of Crown Prince Mohammed, Vision 2030 aims to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. Ironically, however, for that vision to materialize, the kingdom relied on oil revenues. It’s a situation similar to that of the UK, which wants to fund its own transition away from oil and gas with the taxes collected from oil and gas operators. Vision 2030 had plenty of funds when oil prices were high. Now, when prices have become chronically depressed due to algorithmic trading and a preoccupation with Chinese demand growth, the Saudi government is experiencing a shortage of cash, and the debt market is the quickest route to covering that shortage. Related: TotalEnergies to Produce More Gas Condensate Offshore Denmark According to Saudi Arabia’s National Debt Management Center, the kingdom’s total debt stood at some $308.7 billion at the end of September. Of this total, $183.7 billion was domestic debt, and the remaining $125 billion was foreign debt. Compared to U.S. debt, this is nothing. But compared to 2019 debt levels, it is a palpable increase: in 2019, Saudi debt stood at $180.8 billion. It appears that the Saudi leadership is determined to make the Vision 2030 plan work even if it had to endure certain adjustments, and some projects got canceled because they did not make economic sense. Back in 2018, for instance, the Saudis scrapped a $200-billion solar power project that Riyadh was set to build jointly with Japan’s SoftBank. The project was supposed to be the biggest ever, but that did not guarantee its profitability, hence the change of plans. Neom, it seems, remains very much in the game. The $500-billion smart city and low-carbon energy ecosystem is the flagship project of the Vision 2030. Alas, prices for building such projects have not come down along with crude oil benchmarks, raising Saudi borrowing appetite. The budget deficit gap that low oil prices opened also needs plugging. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} Earlier in the year, the International Monetary Fund issued a warning to the decision-makers in Riyadh. It said the kingdom needed oil prices at a level above $96 per barrel in order to break even, given its budget spending. Oil looks quite unlikely to get to even $90, let alone $96 a barrel in the observable future. That means that Saudi Arabia will indeed continue to borrow next year as well as it pursues its diversification. Only now this diversification would be funded with loans rather than oil revenues—until prices start recovering to more palatable levels. Some argue that prices are not going to go much higher whatever Saudi Arabia does in terms of production. Indeed, the 1-million-bpd self-imposed output reduction has not really had the desirable effect on prices because of that same China demand focus among traders. Global supply would need to tighten further for prices to react. The problem with this is that Saudi is losing market share from its output control. It is a serious conundrum: sinking into debt to fund Vision 2030 is not the optimal option, and neither is axing the program entirely after spending so much on it already. Perhaps there is a middle ground that the Saudis could pursue without drowning in debt and remaining tied to oil revenues for public spending.

    "text": "Shumba Energy says site clearance is underway at its planned 100-megawatt solar project near Francistown, which will be the country’s largest when complete. Originally conceived more than three years ago, the Tati Solar photovoltaic project will sit on 300 hectares and is expected to cost more than P800 million. In a quarterly activity update released this week, Shumba Energy directors said procurement for Engineering, Procurement and Construction was nearing completion, with a contract due to be finalised soon. Other key agreements including financing, land lease amendments, as well as, Environment Social and Governance reports are being completed. The project has been granted conditional membership by the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), the SADC regional electricity market. Shumba directors said this membership category is designed to support generators by confirming their participation in SAPP power markets once the projects become commercially operational. By being the country’s first private sector renewable plant to sell solar directly into the SAPP, Shumba will be the first to test the pricing around renewable energy, at a time when nearly all the power available in the market is coal-fired. The pricing is expected to further boost renewable generation in the country, with private sector investors developing utility-scale projects based on the abundant solar energy and flat landscapes in the country.",

    "title": "Good News For EPFO Subscribers: Deadline For UAN Activation & Aadhaar Linking Extended To Jan 15",
    "text": "New Delhi: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the deadline for employees to activate their Universal Account Number (UAN) and link their Aadhaar with their bank accounts. The new deadline is now January 15, 2024, allowing more time for employees to complete the process to claim benefits under the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) Scheme. Previous DeadlineInitially, the deadline was set for November 30, 2024, before being extended to December 15, 2024. With the latest extension, employees have another month to comply with these requirements. The UAN activation and Aadhaar-bank account linking are mandatory steps to access monetary benefits under the ELI scheme, which operates via direct benefit transfers (DBT). Sub-SchemesThe ELI scheme, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the Union Budget 2024 in July, aims to provide financial support to employees and promote job creation. It includes three sub-schemes: Scheme A, targeting first-time employees joining the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF). Scheme B, focusing on job creation in manufacturing sectors. Scheme C, providing support to employers. What EPFO Said In A Circular?In a circular dated December 20, 2024, EPFO stated, “The deadline for UAN activation and Aadhaar seeding in bank accounts of employees has been extended from December 15, 2024, to January 15, 2024.” The Ministry of Labour and Employment emphasized that Aadhaar linking is essential for DBT. It urged employers to ensure that all new employees, particularly those who joined in the current financial year, complete UAN activation and Aadhaar seeding promptly. Benefits Of Linking UAN To Aadhaar CardFor employees, having an activated UAN linked to Aadhaar provides access to several EPFO services through a single portal. These include viewing and downloading provident fund passbooks, making online claims for withdrawals or transfers, updating personal details, and tracking claims in real time. The activation process can be completed using an Aadhaar-based OTP. Benefits Of ELI SchemeThe ELI scheme offers significant monetary benefits, although the specific amounts vary depending on the sub-scheme. While Scheme A supports new EPF members, Scheme B encourages employment in manufacturing, and Scheme C helps employers create more job opportunities.

    "title": "China and Trump’s tariffs: Beijing tries to unleash economy",
    "text": "China’s economy is still struggling to recover from the pandemic, nearly two years after Beijing dropped its draconian zero-COVID lockdowns. In the first three quarters of 2024, economic growth came at 4.8% — just shy of Beijing’s 5% target. Deflation, weak consumer demand and a huge real estate crash have hurt the country’s incredible growth trajectory, while ongoing trade tensions with the United States — likely to worsen under Donald Trump’s second term — have hurt exports, which were credited with helping China’s ascent to become the world’s second-largest economy. “China suffers from overproduction and under-consumption,” George Magnus, a research associate at the University of Oxford’s China Centre and former chief economist at UBS, told DW. “[Chinese leaders] have finally recognized that the economy seems to be losing momentum and is not a one-off.” In September, Beijing injected liquidity into the banking system worth 2.7 trillion yuan ($370 billion, €350 billion) to encourage lending, cut interest rates and announced new infrastructure spending and aid to indebted property developers. Earlier this month, the Chinese government unveiled a further boost worth 10 trillion yuan to help ease a debt crisis among regional governments, which borrowed heavily for infrastructure and economic development projects in recent years. These measures sparked a spectacular short-term rally in Chinese stocks — the CSI 300 index of the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen soared by 35%. Investors bet that Beijing would soon announce trillions more yuan to help boost domestic consumption. “There was speculation that there would be finally demand-side policy to support consumption. So far, none of this has come true,” Singapore-based Jiayu Li, senior associate at the public-policy advisory firm Global Counsel, told DW. Li said that while the package announced was “impressive,” it was primarily focused on restructuring existing debts and “cannot be regarded as a new stimulus.” She said Beijing was still underestimating the size of local government debt at 14.3 trillion yuan. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has put the figure at 60 trillion yuan, or 47.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). The new measures are much larger than the amount unleashed in the wake of the 2008/09 financial crisis, which was worth up to 4 trillion yuan. Then, however, the measures equated to almost 13% of GDP, versus about 10% this year. This intervention helped China to keep GDP growth above 8% during the global downturn. Magnus believes the latest raft of measures will only have a “marginal effect” on growth as they will ease the pressure on local and provincial governments to slash budgets. But he warned that Beijing was “just skirting round the edges” and would quite soon need to take “radical” steps to tackle many structural issues in the economy. Many other China watchers also think the recent moves don’t go far enough, especially with Trump threatening new US tariffs on Chinese imports when he returns to the White House in January. Trump said on Monday he would put an additional 10% levy on all Chinese goods entering the US, potentially raising the overall tariff to 35%. A poll of economists by the Reuters news agency last week predicted that new US tariffs could hurt China’s growth by up to a percentage point. “The market is hoping that Beijing is choosing to hold off on more fiscal measures until next year [when Trump takes office],” Li told DW, adding that concerns are growing that the impact of any potential stimulus will be even more limited by then. Magnus, meanwhile, said he thinks the new tariffs “won’t have a huge impact” on China’s economy, although they may lead to further weakening of the yuan. During the first round of Trump’s tariffs in March 2018, Beijing offset some of the impact by letting the yuan depreciate, which made Chinese exports cheaper. The currency fell by roughly 12% against the US dollar, reaching its lowest point in nearly a decade by August 2019. Washington then labeled China a “currency manipulator,” which sparked even higher US tariffs for months until negotiations eased tensions somewhat between the two powers. Huang Yiping, dean of the National School of Development at Peking University and a member of the People’s Bank of China’s Monetary Policy Committee, has called for a much larger stimulus program to “stabilize and spur domestic demand.” In an interview this month with the South China Morning Post, he called for Beijing to unleash a “Chinese Marshall Plan,” referring to the post-World War II economic aid program launched by the US to rebuild Europe. Huang’s version proposes using China’s surplus industrial capacity to help low-income countries in the Global South build new infrastructure and transition to renewable energies. The proposal is, however, likely to face a backlash from the West, which is already concerned about China’s growing influence in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Other analysts agree that Beijing still needs to inject substantial amounts into the economy — with projections ranging between a further 5 trillion yuan to 10 trillion yuan. Union Bancaire Privee (UBP) Asia senior economist Carlos Casanova told Reuters this month that a 23 trillion yuan package was needed. Many analysts also recommend that any future stimulus should focus on social welfare spending for households and more help for the ailing real estate sector, rather than traditional industrial investment and infrastructure projects. While Magnus agreed that the government will “fine-tune” its policies to boost domestic demand, he is skeptical whether China will speedily move from a production-based, export-driven economy. “I’m not saying that Beijing will be hollow when it comes to further stimulus measures, but I think the government’s priority is certainly not to change the development model to become a more consumer-led, welfare-oriented economy,” he told DW.

    "title": "The grace period for student loan payments is over. Here's what you need to know",
    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on Sept. 30. The “on-ramp” period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. “The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,” said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven't been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here’s what you need to know. The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower’s transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. “Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,\" said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don't make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. Borrowers who can’t or don’t pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month's payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn't been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn't paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you’re struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website . If you’ve worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program , which forgives student debt after 10 years. When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly 9 months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you’re in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income. If a borrower’s earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan , the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don’t have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on Oct. 15. The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on Sept. 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits. —— “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

    "title": "Goldman Sachs Q2 Earnings Preview: Can The Rally Keep Going?",
    "text": "Monty Rakusen/DigitalVision via Getty Images The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ( NYSE: GS ) is set to report its second-quarter earnings on July 15, ahead of the market open. This will be an important update from the global investment banking giant to reaffirm its impressive financial momentum over the past year. The stock is up 22% in 2024, outperforming sector benchmarks and even the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ). We last covered GS following its Q1 result, highlighting how the bank was benefiting from resilient economic conditions and the strong gains in capital markets. While those tailwinds remain in place, our update today considers the latest developments and themes to watch into the second half of the year. Can the stock price rally keep going? Here's what you need to know. Data by YCharts GS Q2 Earnings Preview According to consensus estimates , Goldman Sachs is forecast to report Q2 EPS of $8.57 (for the period ended March 31), representing a 178% increase from the $3.08 result in the period last year. The context considers that Q2 2023 was a historically weak period for investment banking deal-making and also the market volatility surrounding the banking industry turmoil last year. By this measure, Q2 represents a continuation of Goldman's rebound in key segments with a revenue forecast of $12.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year, marking the strongest second quarter since 2021 at the height of the pandemic-era boom. Seeking Alpha The expectation is that higher financial prices support strong trading activity, while also contributing to a valuation gain for Goldman's wealth management assets. In Q1, the firm was ranked number one globally in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions with indications higher advisory fees will add to the bottom line this quarter. Efforts to cut costs, including streamlining its employee headcount and focusing on operational efficiencies should also play a role in earnings this quarter. Compared to fears in recent years that the U.S. could be slipping into a recession and corporate defaults or bankruptcies would surge, the resiliency in credit markets has been the big story in 2024. Naturally, this is a positive for earnings this quarter into net interest income, while areas like exposure to commercial real estate and consumer loans could be an uncertainty. The size of the group's adjustment to the provision for credit losses, reflecting management's assessment of underlying market conditions could mean the difference between an earnings beat or miss this quarter. On this point, the data shows that Goldman's earnings have been inconsistent between exceeding and underperforming Wall Street EPS estimates in several quarters since 2019. Management comments projecting confidence or caution towards the global outlook will be critical to how GS performs on the results. Seeking Alpha Goldman Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Implications One question mark is how the bank plans to address implications from the results of the recent Federal Reserve's 2024 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test . While Goldman Sachs cleared the baseline requirements, the final results suggested a higher Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio requirement of 13.9% going forward, increasing from the 13.0% level mandated in 2023. It appears Goldman was disappointed by the assessment, which implies the bank will need to set aside more capital as a buffer during a hypothetical financial shock. CEO David Solomon made the following comments in a press release: “This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we’ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in the last three tests. We will engage with our regulator to better understand their determinations.” While the change could in theory limit Goldman's ability to invest in its business and increase shareholder distributions, the firm still moved forward with a dividend increase, hiking the quarterly rate by 9% from $2.75 to $3.00. Our takeaway is that the group maintains overall solid fundamentals with the 2024 Stress Test not undermining its earnings trajectory. What's Next For GS? The attraction of Goldman Sachs is its global leadership within investment banking. The good news is that the macro backdrop remains supportive for Goldman and the broader financial services sector. An environment where corporate earnings continue to climb, while inflation stabilizes lower, and the Fed has room to cut interest rates into 2025 allows the group to keep growing and drive earnings higher. On the other hand, these factors are hardly a secret given the stock price performance over the past year where shares of Goldman have returned a remarkable 50%. The challenge is that valuation has shifted from an otherwise compelling and inexpensive position at the end of 2023 toward what is a historically pricey premium today. We're looking at shares of GS trading at a price-to-book multiple of 1.4x, well above the 1.1x average over the past decade. Notably, the other two times the stock reached this premium level, shares faced some selling pressure as the valuation reset lower. Data by YCharts While not necessarily a reason that the stock needs to decline today, the concern is that the next leg higher will require an expansion of these same multiples that becomes harder to achieve. Ideally, we'd like to see Goldman's revenue and earnings accelerate above and beyond their 2021 peaks to justify a higher valuation. For reference, the group posted EPS of $59.45 in 2021 compared to the $36.21 consensus estimates this year or even $40.03 in fiscal 2025. Shares of GS trading at a forward P/E ratio of 13x are at a premium to most other mega-cap bank stocks with the expectation of its investment banking peer Morgan Stanley ( MS ) trading at a 15x ratio. Ultimately, the appearance is that all bank stocks have become pricier in 2024 given the strong sector performance which we believe warrants some caution if many of the strong points have already been priced in. Data by YCharts Final Thoughts We're sticking with a hold rating for shares of Goldman Sachs, implying a neutral view on the near-term direction of the stock price. Recognizing a positive long-term outlook, we'd say that the upside over the near term is limited with a base case scenario for shares to consolidate recent gains. For the Q2 earnings report, key monitoring points include the trends in equities trading and the fixed-income, commodity, and currencies (FICC) business. We'd like to hear a strong update regarding the outlook for investment banking advisory and wealth management assets under supervision. Investors interested in picking up shares may find a more attractive entry point following the results. In terms of risks, a significantly weaker-than-expected report or concerning guidance could open the door for a new round of volatility and force a reassessment of the earnings trajectory.

    "text": "Zoopla expert predicts house prices will fall by 22% by 2026 High house prices and bills means two in three first time buyers are forced to relocate to areas they know nothing about. And as many as 60 percent are taking a chance on moving to places they had not even previously heard of, according to research by Santander. The research found that despite moving to a new area, some 40 percent of young buyers spend less time getting to know their neighbourhood than watching Netflix in a week. The bank said a lack of suitable properties and affordability constraints are the main reasons people are moving further afield. However, it generally means moving away from family, friends and neighbourhoods where they were raised. READ MORE Martin Lewis issues warning to thousands of pensioners missing out on cash boost Santander has set up an information hub to help people relocating (Image: Getty) Santander said: “Two-thirds (67 percent) of Brits who bought their first home in the last two years had never seen their new neighbourhood before buying, compared to just over half (51 percent) of those who bought more than five years ago. “While most make sacrifices in the type of property they buy, whether that’s fewer bedrooms, less garden space, or taking on a renovation project, more first-time buyers are increasingly compromising on the location with three in five (60 percent) moving to an area they had never even heard of, to secure a foot on the property ladder. “What’s more, in a rush to snap up a dream home, 40 percent of buyers are spending less than two hours getting to know an area before buying a property there, with many saying they spent more time watching a series on Netflix or scrolling social media in an average week.” TV presenter Ryan Thomas moved 212 miles from Manchester to Brentwood, Essex, a neighbourhood where he’d never been before, prior to meeting his fiancé, Lucy Mecklenburgh. Trending Ryan said: “It can be daunting moving home, especially when you’re building your life in a completely new area. “Moving away from my family in Manchester was difficult at first and it takes a while to find your feet in an unfamiliar neighbourhood, but I quickly started to get to know the locals, the great places for food, and where to take the kids for a fun day out. “Moving first to Brentwood, and now seven years later, Lucy moving to my hometown Manchester, has shown us both that getting to know a new neighbourhood is full of adventure.” Some 36 percent of new buyers gave their top reason for moving to an unfamiliar neighbourhood as it being cheaper, while 24 percent could not find a property that met their needs. Santander said the average saving by moving further away from a preferred location was £29,000.

    "title": "Kura Oncology Announces Publication of Ziftomenib Phase 1 Results in The Lancet Oncology",
    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Sept. 30, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kura Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: KURA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer, today announced the publication of its KOMET-001 Phase 1 study manuscript in The Lancet Oncology journal. The paper, entitled “Ziftomenib in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (KOMET-001): results from an open-label, multi-cohort, phase 1a/1b trial,” is now available on The Lancet Oncology website and in the Scientific Manuscripts section on Kura’s website. “The results from the KOMET-001 Phase 1 study are encouraging as they demonstrate meaningful benefit of ziftomenib in NPM1 -mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and publication of these data expands the growing evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of ziftomenib in a disease indication of unmet need,” said Ghayas C. Issa, M.D., assistant professor of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “We are thankful for the patients and their families for their participation in the KOMET-001 trial and for the scientific community who have contributed to this research to advance more tolerable and effective treatment options for AML patients.” The KOMET-001 study is a Phase 1/2 global, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of ziftomenib in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. In the Phase 1a dose escalation portion, patients received ziftomenib once daily in 28-day cycles and in the Phase 1b dose validation/expansion portion, patients were randomized to two parallel cohorts at 200 mg and 600 mg. As of the data cutoff on August 30, 2023, 83 patients received one or more doses of ziftomenib and the primary objective of this study was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity. The results demonstrated promising clinical activity with manageable toxicity in heavily pretreated patients including marrow blast reduction, neutrophil and platelet recovery, transfusion independence, and clearance of measurable residual disease. “Our Phase 1 study provided the critical safety and clinical activity data in order to determine the RP2D and support our pivotal Phase 2 registration-directed trial in patients with NPM1 -mutant AML,” said Stephen Dale, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Kura Oncology. “These data reinforce our commitment to developing novel investigational therapies, including menin inhibitors, to realize the transformative value for patients with acute leukemias. The clinical data generated to date, including the insights gained from this study, demonstrate the potential for ziftomenib to become a cornerstone of AML therapy through monotherapy and combination approaches.” In May 2024, Kura Oncology announced completion of enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of KOMET-001, a registration-directed trial of ziftomenib in patients with R/R NPM1-mutant AML. Enrollment of the 85 patients in Phase 2 was completed in fewer than 16 months and the Company expects to report topline data from the trial in early 2025. About NPM1 -mutant AML AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults and begins when the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (white blood cells), red blood cells or platelets. Despite the many available treatments for AML, prognosis for patients remains poor and a high unmet need remains. The menin pathway is considered a driver for multiple genetic alterations of the disease, of which NPM1 mutations are among the most common, representing approximately 30% of AML cases. While patients with NPM1 -m AML have high response rates to frontline therapy, relapse rates are high and survival outcomes are poor, with only 30% overall survival at 12 months in the R/R setting. Additionally, NPM1 mutations frequently occur with co-mutations in other disease-associated genes, including FLT3 , DNMT3A and IDH1/2 , with prognosis heavily influenced by the presence of co-occurring mutations. Adult patients with NPM1 -m AML and select co-mutations and/or R/R disease have a poor prognosis, with median overall survival of only approximately 7.8 months in 2 nd line, 5.3 months in 3 rd line, and 3.5 months following the 4 th line 1 . There are currently no FDA-approved therapies targeting NPM1 -m AML. About Ziftomenib Ziftomenib is a novel, once-daily, oral investigational drug candidate targeting the menin-KMT2A/MLL protein-protein interaction for treatment of genetically defined AML patients with high unmet need. In the KOMET-001 Phase 1 study, ziftomenib demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability with reported events consistent with features and manifestations of underlying disease. Clinical activity of ziftomenib as a monotherapy was optimal at the 600 mg daily dose and a 35% complete remission rate was observed in 20 patients with NPM1 -mutant AML treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (600 mg). Ziftomenib has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of R/R NPM1 -mutant AML. Additional information about clinical trials for ziftomenib can be found at kuraoncology.com/clinical-trials/#ziftomenib . About Kura Oncology Kura Oncology is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. The Company’s pipeline consists of small molecule drug candidates that target cancer signaling pathways. Ziftomenib, a once-daily, oral drug candidate targeting the menin-KMT2A protein-protein interaction, has received BTD for the treatment of R/R NPM1 -mutant AML. Kura has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib in R/R NPM1-mutant AML (KOMET-001). The Company is also conducting a series of clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standards of care in newly diagnosed and R/R NPM1 -mutant and KMT2A -rearranged AML. Kura is evaluating KO-2806, a next-generation farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI), in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial as a monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapies (FIT-001).

    "text": "FRANKFURT :German chipmaker Infineon has settled a more than decade-long legal dispute over insolvent former unit Qimonda, agreeing to pay a higher than initially planned 753.5 million euros ($837 million), both companies said late on Thursday. The settlement with Qimonda insolvency administrator Michael Jaffe will not affect Infineon's operating profitability, a company spokesperson said, adding that it had already taken provisions amounting to 221 million euros over the case. While the settlement will weigh on earnings and cash flow from discontinued operations, according to the chipmaker's overnight statement, the spokesperson said it will not restrict Infineon's ongoing business and the group has enough funds for dividends and investments. The bill for the chipmaker is much less than the 3.35 billion euros initially demanded by Qimonda, RoboMarkets analyst Juergen Molnar said, although it was more than the amount that Infineon had set aside. \"The bottom line is rather at the more expensive end for Infineon, but at least it's an end and therefore time for management and shareholders to concentrate on the operational business,\" Molnar said. Jaffe had sued Infineon in 2010 for 3.35 billion euros, arguing the chipmaker had transferred operations to it at an inflated price. So far, he has won 1.2 billion for Qimonda creditors in total. Qimonda was spun off from Infineon in 2006 but collapsed in 2009 after chip prices plunged, and it had to file for insolvency after failing to hammer out details of a rescue package with its parent company. The administrator added that the conclusion of insolvency proceedings will be possible in 2025, with substantial dividends for the creditors. Infineon's stock opened 1 per cent lower but then pared losses and was down 0.2 per cent by 1018 GMT. A local trader noted the initial negative reaction should not hold, as the legal matter is now solved and the market is more focused on Infineon's continued operations. It would also not need new money for the settlement. ($1 = 0.8990 euros)",

    "text": "RIYADH: Bandar Alkhorayaf, Saudi Arabia’s mining and industry minister, will visit Brazil and Chile this week, the ministry said on Sunday. In Brazil, he will hold meetings with officials to discuss expanding the Kingdom’s mining capacity, food processing, and aviation, while in Chile he will explore lithium production, needed for electric vehicle batteries. “This aligns with the Kingdom’s direction towards expanding the production of EVs,” a Saudi government statement said. Alkhorayaf will land in Brazil on Monday and leave for Chile, the world’s second-largest producer of lithium, next Sunday. On the first leg of the tour in Brazil, Alkhorayaf will meet agricultural and industrial groups, including Minerva Foods, JBS, and BRF SA, as well as the Brazilian Mining Association and mining company Vale. Brazil’s Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said last month that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund plans to invest $15 billion in Brazil in areas such as green hydrogen, infrastructure, and renewable energy. In Chile, the minister will meet his counterpart Aurora Williams, as well as mining companies Antofagasta, and Codelco, a state-run company tasked with bringing the Chilean government into the lithium industry. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the PIF, and the Kingdom’s mining company, known as Ma’aden, which is 67 percent owned by the PIF, formed a joint venture called Manara Minerals to invest in mining assets abroad.",

    "title": "HYGV: Beating Other Junk Bond ETFs, But Lagging Fallen Angels",
    "text": "Nastassia Samal This article series aims at evaluating ETFs (exchange-traded funds) regarding past performance and portfolio metrics. Reviews with updated data are posted when necessary. HYGV strategy FlexShares® High Yield Value-Scored Bond Index Fund ETF ( NYSEARCA: HYGV ) is an ETF investing in high-yield corporate bonds (referred to as \"junk bonds\"). It has 1,048 holdings, a distribution rate of 8.49%, a 30-day SEC yield of 7.44%, a net expense ratio of 0.37% and pays monthly distributions. It was launched on 07/17/2018 and tracks the Northern Trust High Yield Value-Scored US Corporate Bond Index. As described in the prospectus by FlexShares , the underlying index implements a rules-based methodology to select and weight U.S.-listed, US-dollar denominated bonds below investment grade (but not in default). For this purpose, it uses a value score, credit score, and liquidity score, mostly based on quantitative rankings of characteristics obtained from company filings. Additionally, \" the optimization process also includes issuer level, sector, effective duration, low credit and liquidity score, duration band, and turnover constraints to seek to manage systematic risk .\" The portfolio turnover rate is high: 167% in the most recent fiscal year. Portfolio About 84% of asset value is invested in the debt of U.S. companies. Canada weighs 4.9%, while Australia, Luxembourg and the U.K. are in a 2% to 3% range. Other countries are below 1%. Regarding sectors, the fund is overweight in industrials (36.7% of assets). Sector breakdown (Chart: author; data: FlexShares) Almost half of asset value is in securities with a BB rating, the highest for junk bonds (BBB is investment grade). Credit risk profile (Chart: author, data: FlexShares) About 62% of assets have maturity below five years. Maturity profile (Chart: author; data: FlexShares) The top 10 holdings, listed below, represent 7.1% of the portfolio. Performance Since its inception in 2018, HYGV has outperformed a junk bond benchmark, represented by iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF ( HYG ). However, the gap in total return is only about 4% over six years. HYGV vs HYG since 7/18/2018 (Seeking Alpha) Excluding distributions, HYGV has lost about 18% in value since its inception. HYG was a bit better at protecting capital, although a 7.6% loss isn't pretty either. Making the price decay worse for both funds, the cumulative inflation was about 25% in this time frame, based on CPI. HYGV vs HYG, price return (Seeking Alpha) The annual sum of distributions has hardly increased between 2019 and 2023, from $3.44 to $3.58 per share. This 4% dividend growth was more than offset by the cumulative inflation (about 19%). Moreover, distribution history doesn't show a steady trend: HYGV distribution history (Seeking Alpha) HYGV vs. Competitors The next table compares the characteristics of HYGV and five high-yield corporate bond ETFs implementing rules-based strategies: HYGV has the highest four-year average yield. The next chart plots total returns since its inception. HYGV is in the middle of the pack, significantly lagging the two \"fallen angels\" funds, which invest in the debt of companies having lost their investment grade rating. HYGV vs. Competitors since 7/18/2018 (Seeking Alpha) Takeaway FlexShares High Yield Value-Scored Bond Index Fund ( HYGV ) is a junk bond ETF focused on fundamentals and risk management. It's overweight in debt of U.S. industrial companies. Since its inception, HYGV has outperformed a junk bond benchmark and several competitors. On the downside: For these reasons, I don't see HYGV as an attractive long-term investment and I give it a \"Sell\" rating. However, like many ETFs, it may be profitable for seasoned investors as a swing trading instrument. Many high yield ETFs and closed-end funds suffer from capital and distribution decay. However, decay can be avoided or mitigated by rotational strategies, instead of using funds as long-term investments.

    "title": "Asia-Pacific markets open higher as U.S. inflation report fuels Fed rate cut expectations",
    "text": "This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets. Asia-Pacific markets open higher on Thursday after the U.S.' October consumer price index reading fueled expectations for the Fed to cuts rates again in December. Philadelphia news 24/7: Watch NBC10 free wherever you are The CPI came in line with expectations, accelerating slightly to an annual inflation rate of 2.6%. Core CPI, which straps out volatile food and energy prices, gained 3.3% last month, also matching expectations. Australia's unemployment rate remained steady in October at 4.1%, as economists had expected, while the number of employed people increased 15,900 from a month ago, falling short of the 25,000 that was expectationed. The participation rate, which measures the share of working age people currently employed or seeking a job, stood at 67.1%, slightly below an estimated 67.2%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.43%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.82% while the Topix added 0.92%. Japanese yen appreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar to 155.36 on Thursday, after falling below the 155 benchmark overnight, hovering near the lowest level in over four months. South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.82%, while the Kosdaq Index was up 1.73%. The country's markets opened an hour later than usual on Thursday because of national college entrance exams. Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng index stood at 19,612, set to extend a multi-day losing streak that saw the index close at 19,823.45 Wednesday. Overnight in the U.S., the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed near the flatline following the release of the inflation report. The S&P 500 inched higher by 0.02% to close at 5,985.38, while the 30-stock Dow ticked up 47.21 points, or 0.11%, to 43,958.19. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day with a 0.26% decline and closed at 19,230.74. The inflation data puts the Federal Reserve on course to lower interest rates next month, with markets pricing in a 80.8% likelihood of a quarter-percentage-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . — CNBC's Brian Evans and Hakyung Kim contributed to this report. Bitcoin tops $90,000 Bitcoin extended its postelection rally Wednesday, breaking above $90,000. The flagship cryptocurrency was last up 1% at $90,796. — Fred Imbert Dollar index reaches highest point since April The dollar index rose 0.4% Wednesday to 106.50, its strongest level since April 16, when it reached 106.517. Meanwhile, the euro fell 0.6% against the dollar to 1.0569. This market the euro's lowest point against the greenback since Nov. 2, 2023, when it traded as low as 1.0564. — Hakyung Kim Dallas Fed President Logan advises to 'proceed with caution' on cuts Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan urged caution on policy in a speech Wednesday in an environment where the longer-term interest rate trajectory could be higher than normal. Logan said she generally sees inflation heading lower and the labor market easing but stable. Yet she said there are risks to the Fed's policymaking \"voyage\" that need to be considered, in which inflation could hold above the Fed's 2% target. \"I anticipate the [Federal Open Market Committee] will most likely need more rate cuts to finish the journey. But it's difficult to be sure how many cuts may be needed and how soon they may need to happen,\" she said during an appearance in her home district. If the Fed cuts rates past the \"neutral\" level that neither boosts nor restricts growth, \"inflation could reaccelerate and the FOMC could need to reverse direction. In these uncertain but potentially very shallow waters, I believe it's best to proceed with caution,\" said Logan who will not have a vote on the FOMC until 2026. —Jeff Cox Republicans win House control and complete full sweep of power in Washington Republicans will maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives, NBC News reported Wednesday , as Donald Trump's return to the White House will see his party take full control of Washington. The majority is one of the more narrow divides in recent history for the Congress' lower chamber, but the makeup will allow Trump to more swiftly confirm his cabinet picks and attempt to fulfill his legislative agenda. Trump ran on extending tax cuts from his first term and deregulation. — Brian Evans S&P 500, Dow close near the flatline The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed little changed on Wednesday as Wall Street's postelection rally wavered. The S&P 500 added 0.02% to close at 5,985.38, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.26% to 19,230.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 47 points, or 0.11%, to finish at 43,958.19. — Brian Evans Market raises expectations for December rate cut following inflation report The October inflation reading released Wednesday raised market expectations that the Federal Reserve will be cutting benchmark interest rates again in December. Following the October consumer price index release, which showed the 12-month inflation rate at 2.6%, meeting forecasts, traders upped odds for a quarter percentage point reduction to about 82%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. A day earlier, the market-implied probability was at just 59%. Traders then expect the Fed to skip January and then cut again in March. —Jeff Cox CNBC Pro: This 145-year-old British engineering firm is set to benefit from an onshoring and automation trend — with analysts giving the stock 60% upside ﻿A 145-year-old British industrial company is positioned to capitalize on major trends, including the reshoring of manufacturing and increased defense spending, according to analysts at Shore Capital. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to apply 10% import duties on products brought into the U.S., with imports from China potentially facing additional duties of up to 60%. However, this U.K.-listed company runs two factories each in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia and could potentially avoid Trump's trade tariffs .

The Impact of Insider Transactions on Investments Insider transactions, although significant, should be considered within the larger context of market analysis and trends. Exploring the legal landscape, an \"insider\" is defined as any officer, director, or beneficial owner holding more than ten percent of a company's equity securities, as stipulated by Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This encompasses executives in the c-suite and major hedge funds. These insiders are required to report their transactions through a Form 4 filing, which must be submitted within two business days of the transaction. Highlighted by a company insider's new purchase, there's a positive anticipation for the stock to rise. But, insider sells may not necessarily indicate a bearish view and can be motivated by various factors. Navigating the World of Insider Transaction Codes Investors prefer focusing on transactions that take place in the open market, indicated in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 indicates a purchase, while S indicates a sale. Transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option, and transaction code A indicates grant, award or other acquisition of securities from the company.

    "title": "Nordstrom to be acquired by Nordstrom family and a Mexican retail group in $6.25 billion deal",
    "text": "Century-old department store Nordstrom has agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal with the industry being squeezed by discount chains and other competition. Public companies are under a lot more scrutiny and if private, the Nordstrom may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that has been attempting to reinvigorate sales for years. Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, when reports of a potential transaction was reported by the media. The acquiring group will also pick up more than $2 billion in Nordstrom debt. The traditional department stores have suffered in the face of withering competition from giants like Walmart and Target, as well as a host of fast-fashion bands and Amazon.com. Nordstrom rivals Macy's and Kohl's have been pressured by major investors to make huge changes in order to return more profit to shareholders. Sales at Nordstrom have essentially flatlined over the past decade or so and it announced last year that it was closing all of its Canadian stores and cutting 2,500 jobs as it winds down operations in the country. Nordstrom first announced plans to expand to Canada in 2012 and opened its first store in Calgary at CF Chinook Centre in September 2014. The offer announced Monday tops the previous $23-per-share bid that the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group, El Puerto de Liverpool, made in September. The board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, based on Nordstrom’s cash on hand immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company's shares will no longer trade publicly. “While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long-term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short-term scrutiny of public markets,” wrote Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData, in a note to clients. Nordstrom’s board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company — recusing themselves from that vote. Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom family will have a majority ownership stake in the company. Erik and Pete Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leadership at the Seattle retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company’s chief executive and Peter is president. After opening 23 new stores so far this year, the company now operates a combined 381 Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S. Nordstrom shares fell about 1.5% Monday, but they are up 34% this year on rumors of a family takeover. The company's stock is still down considerably from post-pandemic highs above $40 per share. In May of this year, Bruce Nordstrom, a retail executive who helped expand his family’s Pacific Northwest department store chain into an upscale national brand, died at age 90 . He was one of several Nordstrom family members who in 2017 made a push to take the company private, proposing to buy out the 70% of the department store’s stock they didn’t already own. Those talks failed in 2018 but earlier this year, his sons started another series of buyout negotiations , leading to Monday's announcement. Matt Ott, The Associated Press",

    "title": "Fortify Your Digital Treasure: The Safest Crypto Wallets of 2024!",
    "text": "In an age where digital treasures are more precious than gold, crypto losses have skyrocketed to a staggering $2 billion this year, with hacking incidents spiking 21% compared to the last. These hair-raising figures underscore an urgent need for the most secure crypto wallets. Yet, the fortress needs more than just thick walls. Today’s ultimate wallet also equips its bearers with cutting-edge tools to outpace market shifts and swell their coffers. This includes the agility to hop across blockchains, sophisticated trading tools, and the golden opportunity to earn passive income. Look into our exploration of the four stalwarts guarding the crypto realm this year: Plus Wallet, Trust Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Ledger Wallet. Our deep dive into their arsenals will arm you with the knowledge to pick the shield that best guards your digital gold. 1. Plus Wallet: The Vault That Pays You Back Emerging as a titan in the crypto defense league, Plus Wallet offers an impenetrable safe haven with a suite of mighty features. It anchors private keys right on your device, granting you the sole key to your digital vault. This local safekeeping, fortified by unbreakable encryption, slashes the dangers lurking with third-party storage.

It’s your magic carpet to the bustling bazaars of decentralized applications, from Uniswap to Compound, and to the vibrant alleys of NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. The wallet facilitates secure crypto exchanges with ease. However, it may fall short in the realm of customer support and educational riches—a potential chink in its armor for those seeking wisdom along their journey. Furthermore, its alliance with Binance, the centralized empire, might deter purists dreaming of complete decentralization. 3. Ledger Wallet: The Movable Fortress Closing our list with Ledger, the steadfast hardware wallet, including models like the Nano S Plus and Nano X, offers a robust yet flexible way to manage a diverse array of cryptocurrencies through the intuitive Ledger Live app. These compact warriors are ready to secure your assets on the go. The Nano X even boasts Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to manage your fortunes wirelessly via mobile devices. While Ledger marries convenience with security, the cost of its armor and its closed-source nature have sparked debates about its transparency. 4. OKX Wallet: The Multi-Chain Knight OKX Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain maestro, is ready to guard your cryptos on both Mac OS and Windows.

    "title": "Patrick Industries, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results",
    "text": "Third Quarter 2024 Highlights (compared to Third Quarter 2023 unless otherwise noted) Net sales increased 6% to $919 million driven by a 13% increase in Housing revenue and our first quarter acquisition of Sportech, which together more than offset a 21% decline in Marine revenue. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 8.1%. For the first nine months of 2024, adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 7.8%. Net income increased 3% to $41 million . Diluted earnings per share of $1.80 included the dilutive impact of our convertible notes and related warrants in the period, or an estimated $0.06 per share. For the first nine months of 2024, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $5.75 . Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $121 million ; adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 13.2%. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $224 million for the first nine months of the year compared to $294 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow, on a trailing twelve-month basis, was $277 million . Completed the acquisition of RecPro, which significantly increases our penetration into the RV aftermarket, while also providing synergy opportunity for our Marine and Powersports end markets to sell through a more advanced aftermarket distribution channel. Maintained solid balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the third quarter with a total net leverage ratio of 2.6x following the acquisition of RecPro and liquidity of $458 million . Subsequent to quarter end, the Company amended and extended the maturity of its credit facility, and also issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032. The Company plans to redeem its 7.500% Senior Notes due 2027 with a portion of the proceeds. Patrick plans to host an investor day in New York City on December 3, 2024 . ELKHART, Ind. , Oct. 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Patrick Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: PATK ) (\"Patrick\" or the \"Company\"), a leading component solutions provider for the Outdoor Enthusiast and Housing markets, today reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024. Net sales increased 6% to $919 million , an increase of $53 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The growth in net sales was due to a 13% increase in Housing revenue coupled with revenue gains from our Sportech acquisition, which closed in January of this year. These factors more than offset a 21% decline in Marine revenue as marine OEMs as well as OEMs across our other Outdoor Enthusiast markets continued to maintain highly disciplined production schedules in an effort to manage dealer inventory in alignment with current end market demand. Operating income of $74 million in the third quarter of 2024 increased $3 million , or 5%, compared to $71 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating margin of 8.1% decreased 10 basis points compared to 8.2% in the same period a year ago, reflecting higher SG&A expenses and amortization costs related to acquisitions. For the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 7.8%. Net income increased 3% to $41 million , compared to $40 million in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share of $1.80 in the third quarter of 2024 included approximately $0.06 of dilution from our convertible notes and related warrants. There was no dilutive impact from the convertible notes in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, excluding acquisition transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments in both periods, adjusted net income increased 14% to $128 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $5.75 . Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 included approximately $0.10 of dilution from our 2028 convertible notes and related warrants. The prior year period included approximately $0.05 of dilution related to our 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, which were repaid in cash in February 2023. \"The Patrick team delivered another quarter of solid results with revenue and net income growth supported by the continued diversification of our business,\" said Andy Nemeth , Chief Executive Officer. \"The resilience of our model is directly related to the dedication and talent of our incredible team members, and the strategic investments we have made enabling Patrick to perform well during a prolonged period of inventory destocking that has continued to affect our Outdoor Enthusiast end markets at different times over the last two years.\" Jeff Rodino , President — RV, said, \"This quarter, we welcomed RecPro into our family of brands, which meaningfully expands our position in the direct-to-consumer RV and enthusiast aftermarket. We are energized by the depth and breadth of their product offering, the synergies across our business, and their tremendous leadership and expertise in e-commerce and aftermarket sales. We believe RecPro's efficient distribution channel and significant consumer reach will substantially enhance our ability to provide Patrick's valuable aftermarket solutions across all of our end markets.\" Third Quarter 2024 Revenue by Market Sector (compared to Third Quarter 2023 unless otherwise noted) RV (43% of Revenue) Revenue of $396 million decreased 1% while wholesale RV industry unit shipments increased 6%. Content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased by 1% to $4,887 . Compared to the second quarter of 2024, content per wholesale RV unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased 2%. Marine (15% of Revenue) Revenue of $136 million decreased 21% while estimated wholesale powerboat industry unit shipments decreased 23%. Our Marine end market revenue previously included Powersports revenue, which we began to report separately following the Sportech acquisition. End market revenue and content per unit reflect this change for the relevant periods. Estimated content per wholesale powerboat unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) decreased 6% to $3,936 . Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale powerboat unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) was flat. Powersports (10% of Revenue) Revenue of $87 million increased 204%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Sportech in the first quarter of 2024. Housing (32% of Revenue, comprised of Manufactured Housing (\"MH\") and Industrial) Revenue of $300 million increased 13%; estimated wholesale MH industry unit shipments increased 17%; total housing starts decreased 3%. Estimated content per wholesale MH unit (on a trailing twelve-month basis) increased 1% to $6,518 . Compared to the second quarter of 2024, estimated content per wholesale MH unit increased 1%. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation For the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $224 million compared to $294 million for the prior year period, with the change primarily driven by investments in working capital. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $18 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting maintenance capital expenditures and continued investments in alignment with our automation and technology initiatives. On a trailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow through the third quarter of 2024 was $277 million , compared to $412 million through the third quarter of 2023 when we aggressively monetized working capital in a declining sales environment. Our long-term debt increased approximately $70 million during the third quarter of 2024, primarily as the result of the RecPro acquisition, which closed on September 6, 2024 . We remained disciplined in allocating and deploying capital, returning approximately $12 million to shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 through dividends. We remain opportunistic on share repurchases and had $78 million left authorized under our current share repurchase plan at the end of the third quarter. Our total debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.4 billion , resulting in a total net leverage ratio of 2.6x (as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement). Available liquidity, comprised of borrowing availability under our credit facility and cash on hand, was approximately $458 million . Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we reduced our cost of debt and increased our liquidity position by issuing $500 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032 and expanding the capacity of our credit facility to $1.0 billion , while extending the maturity date to October 2029 . We plan to use a portion of the proceeds from these transactions to redeem our 7.500% Senior Notes on November 7, 2024 . Following these transactions, the Company's next major debt maturity will be in 2028. Business Outlook and Summary \"Our team remains confident in the strength of our brand portfolio, disciplined operating model, earnings power of the business, and the profitable runway of opportunity that exists in each of our primary end markets,\" continued Mr. Nemeth. \"We are intensely focusing on elevating the customer experience, invigorating our team's entrepreneurial spirit, winning additional market share by exceeding customer expectations, and growing the business through accretive acquisitions while strategically allocating capital toward automation and innovation initiatives. Over the last year, the teams at Patrick, in collaboration with our Advanced Product Group, have significantly expanded our product development and prototyping activities as a way to bring next-generation solutions to our customers over the next few years.

PATRICK INDUSTRIES, INC. Non-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides financial metrics, such as net leverage ratio, content per unit, free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share (adjusted diluted EPS), adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and available liquidity, which we believe are important measures of the Company's business performance. These metrics should not be considered alternatives to U.S. GAAP. Our computations of net leverage ratio, content per unit, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted dilutive EPS, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and available liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Content per unit metrics are generally calculated using our market sales divided by Company estimates based on third-party measures of industry volume. We calculate EBITDA by adding back depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, and income tax expense to net income. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking EBITDA and adding back stock-based compensation and loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisition related costs, acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments and subtracting out gain on sale of property, plant and equipment. Adjusted net income is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs, net of tax and acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments, net of tax. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by our weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by removing the impact of acquisition related transaction costs and acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up adjustments. We calculate free cash flow by subtracting cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment from cash flow from operations. RV wholesale unit shipments are provided by the RV Industry Association. Marine wholesale unit shipments are Company estimates based on data provided by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. MH wholesale unit shipments are provided by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Housing starts are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. You should not consider these metrics in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. SOURCE Patrick Industries, Inc.",

    "text": "Rithm Capital ( RITM 1.86% ) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Jul 31, 2024 , 8:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning and welcome to the Rithm Capital second-quarter 2024 earnings call. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Emma Bolla, associate general counsel. Please go ahead. Emma Bolla -- Associate General Counsel Thank you and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us today for Rithm Capital's second-quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Mike Nierenberg, chairman, CEO, and president of Rithm Capital; Nick Santoro, chief financial officer of Rithm Capital; and Baron Silverstein, president of Newrez. Throughout the call, we are going to reference the earnings supplement that was posted this morning to the Rithm Capital website www.rithmcap.com. If you've not already done so, I'd encourage you to download the presentation now. I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. I encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and earnings supplement regarding forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings supplement. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Rithm had an excellent quarter with strong contributions from all of our business lines. While we continue to focus on the direct lending business lines which have gotten us to this point, the growth of our alternative asset business is very important to the revaluation of our company. During the quarter; Newrez, our mortgage company; Genesis, our RTL lender, and our portfolio of assets generated very strong returns. The scope to business, which we have owned since November of last year is seeing excellent performance in credit, real estate, and in the multi-strat fund. AUM is stable, and the teams are having great conversations with LPs. During the quarter, we did several transactions. We closed the previously announced acquisition of SLS, which is a mortgage company. This deal added to the Newrez platform, 56 billion in owned servicing, and another 100 billion third-party servicing. We closed on our previously announced investment in our Sculptor CLO business, a captive CLO equity fund. This helps support the franchise, generates great returns for the house, and should increase enterprise value for both Sculptor and Rithm at the top of the house. We completed the previously announced acquisition of the Management Contract of Great Ajax, which was a residential mortgage REIT, which is now we're going to transition that into an opportunistic commercial mortgage REIT, which will help generate fee-related earnings for shareholders as we reposition the company and grow it. We also added 40 billion of excess MSRs, where we partnered with Sculptor on this acquisition. This shows the power of our franchise. Looking at the macro picture, we are extremely well-positioned for the future and the expectations, and with the expectations of the Fed lowering rates beginning in September, this bodes very well for our company. This will help lower our borrowing costs and hopefully lead to higher earnings. We do believe a steeper curve will lead to higher prices and tighter spreads as the cost of finance from mortgage-related assets comes down with SOFR going lower on a nominal rate basis. This will generate solid returns and earnings for the business and good returns for our LPs and shareholders. One thing you'll see that's a little bit different in our presentation this time is a couple of slides illustrating sum of the parts of our business. I'm hopeful that this will help show the value of our company and the value proposition for our shareholders and LPs. I'll now refer to the supplement, which has been posted online. I'm going to start with Page 3. Baron, who's with me, will focus on the mortgage company. So now to Page 3. This slide demonstrates the kind of the power of the overall franchise. If you look back in history in just a little bit, taking you backwards, company was started in 2013 with $1 billion of equity capital. Today we have $7.3 billion of permanent capital. We paid out over 5.4 billion of dividends. Total economic return is 189%. When you look at the Sculptor franchise and you look at the breadth of that investment team, whether it be in real estate, whether it be around the multi-strat fund, whether it be in credit, you look at the power of the Rithm franchise on the investment side. There is not a sector that we don't have expertise in, whether it be in credit, real estate, mortgage, or on the consumer side. And then when you look at the power of our direct lending businesses and our continued desire to grow those, I'm really excited for the future of what our company will be. As you look at Q2 financial highlights, book value $12.39 per diluted share, GAAP net income of $213 million or $0.43 per diluted share, earnings available for distribution $231 million or $0.47 per diluted share; dividend still $0.25. That's a 9.2% dividend yield as of the end of June, economic return for Q2 3.7%; earnings after distribution return on equity 15%, and cash and liquidity at the end of Q2 was $1.5 billion. Page 5 and 6, I'm going to talk a little bit about the value, our intrinsic value in the sum of the parts. Going back, and again, we'll go back to the end of June, end of Q2. Current valuation at the end of Q2 was $5.4 billion in market cap, share price at the end of June was $11.22, book value $6.1 billion. When you look at the sum of the parts there are -- you can compare us to anybody else in, I think, in the business when you look at some of this but like Newrez, the mortgage company, there were public peers out there. We put a range of 1.1 to 1.5 times. I would encourage you to look at some of the public companies that trade out there. On the investment portfolio and the sum of the parts valuation, we assume roughly book value there. Our Genesis business which continues to generate very good returns and grow we put at 1.2 to 1.5 times multiple on that business. And then Sculptor just put in at our acquisition cost of one point -- at one times our acquisition cost. What that does, and I don't know what the exact number should be, it gets us to a range of value between roughly $13 and $16 per share or price to book value of one point -- at the low of one times on GAAP measures, of 1.3 times at the high end. The valuation lift, you can -- again, you can make up whatever number you want, it's between 15% and 45%. We'll get there at some point and I do think the -- when you look at the real math behind all of our numbers, we're really -- we think it's a great value prop for our shareholders and LPs. Page 6, just looking at, again, talking about the -- I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this, I encourage you to have a look at this. You look at where we think current value is today and where we think it could go. Again, this is why people buy equities. And from a performance standpoint, as a team here, both across all of our platforms, we take it to ensure or do the best we can to make sure that we generate great results for our shareholders and LPs. Page 7, Rithm 2.0, why are we different today? Again, we have our direct lending businesses, and that could be Newrez, that could be the Genesis Capital business. One of the slides I'll get to in a minute just talks about Rithm Commercial. It's really more of direct lending of the Rithm balance sheet. It doesn't compete with any of our other strategies. And one of the things you'll see is the leverage of the overall platform. One of the things I opened up in our opening remarks is if you look during the quarter, we bought a large pool of excess MSRs that was $40-odd billion, and we did that in partnership with the Sculptor franchise. So the power of the franchise and the way that we look at it and where we think we're going to go from both the investment side, our direct lending business, and then as time goes by the Sculptor business should hopefully continue to grow and the great results that they're currently seeing there will help lead to more LP investments. When we look at Page 8, just talking about the markets a little bit, I spoke about what we did in the quarter. Genesis Capital, just to give you a sense on that business, we acquired that in December, I believe of 2022. EBITDA growth in that business since the time that we acquired that is probably up something around -- I think it's up about 50% since we acquired the company in June of 2022. Again, another direct lending business. During the quarter, we did our first securitization -- rated securitization in lowering our cost of capital there at the Genesis level. Financing. The financing market is extremely healthy these days. If you look at -- whether you look at your Bloomberg or you look at the say there are tons and tons of securitizations and deals that come to market as well as in the high-yield space, and I'll talk about that in a minute as well. When we look at our Sculptor franchise, I did mention, we -- Sculptor closed two CLOs during the quarter for $780 million. They also had a new investment in the real estate credit fund. And then the other -- some of the other things we did, we completed our acquisition of Great Ajax. And again, going back to performance first, that is the most important thing for us, not just AUM growth, but performance first. Page 9, and then I'm going to turn it over to Baron. Just key macroeconomic themes. We do think the Fed is going to lower rates if the data continues in September by 25 basis points, that will lead to lower cost of financing on mortgage-related assets, as I spoke about earlier. The yield curve should continue to steepen with the front end doing better or the back end selling off. You could make an argument that when you look at true net treasury supply, I was reading yesterday, I think the treasury -- the deficit is about $35 trillion. We expect roughly $1 trillion of net supply to hit the treasury market this year. When you look at that and you think about the Bank of Japan raising rates this morning, what does all that mean, potentially you could see some capital get recycled back toward Japan where people think they're going to earn more interest income. So it will be interesting to see how that plays out. Market volatility, we believe will continue to persist. The geopolitical world or environment that we all live in is not that comforting and there will be a lot -- we believe there'll be a lot more market volatility. Private credit will continue to expand. You just saw this morning, Ares announced, they raised $34 billion for new private credit fund. It's a big world. There's a lot of opportunity for us out there, and we're excited to actually seize on that opportunity. That's kind of it for now. I think I do -- one last comment on commercial real estate, and then we'll get back to that in a minute. We have -- there is a ton of demand and a ton of incoming that we have as an institution for folks looking for capital in the credit space, in the commercial real estate world, and I'll talk about that in a few. So with that, I'll turn it over to Baron, who will pick up on Slide 10. Baron Silverstein -- President, NewRez All right. Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. We wrapped up another great quarter here at Newrez and we're firmly in growth mode, gaining market share and just focused on disciplined management and also expansion of our third-party client base. We're now the second-largest nonbank servicer and the fifth-largest lender in the industry. And our growth is through our originations business, it is really just to drive and allows us to meet customers where and how they want to be met. And then we're there with our recapture engine that really sets us well for our rate rally. Our servicing platform has a scale and long history of third-party servicing for our clients, and we continue to gain market share. And gain market share, not only on bringing new clients but also gaining wallet share on our existing customer base. So our view overall is we can continue to grow our business and both organically and inorganically, but stay focused on our operational excellence while maximizing performance for our shareholders. Moving to Slide 11, we delivered another strong quarter, and that's just building upon the foundation we've already constructed over the last few years. Our second-quarter pre-tax income was $248 million, delivering a 23% ROE, excluding mark-to-market on the owned portfolio. Excluding MSR mark-to-market, our pre-tax income increased 7% quarter over quarter, reinforcing the strength of our balanced business model overall. Key drivers include the acquisition of SLS, which closed on May 1st that Michael mentioned earlier. We added $56 billion in owned MSRs and $98 billion in third-party MSR servicing, growing our MSR portfolio 28% quarter over quarter and third-party servicing 92% quarter over quarter. We also completed the transition of all 800-plus thousand SLS loans onto our servicing platform which we believe to be the first in the industry to move so many loans in such a short period of time while still minimizing homeowner disruptions and maximizing cost and expense management. Our originations business also performed well in spite of overall margin pressures, with production volume up 35% quarter over quarter, led by our correspondent and wholesale channels but also benefited from the addition of co-issue capabilities and growth in both non-QM and home equity originations overall. Overall, I'll just say, I believe our business is as best positioned it's ever been, and I'm looking forward to continuing to tell the Newrez story to the market. Back to you, Michael. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Baron. A few more slides for me, and then we'll open up for Q&A. Genesis Capital, again, that's our transitional lending business, very focused on high-quality loans to extremely strong sponsors. Most of the time, there's a full recourse back to the very same sponsors that we're providing capital to. In the quarter, I think we did something close to $300 million of production. When we first acquired the company, they were doing something between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of production. This year, we'll hit $3-plus billion in production. And as I mentioned, the EBITDA on that business is going to be up a little bit north of 50% since the time that we acquired that. When you look at Page 13, again, very strong ROE, and this is a common theme for us. It's not only what we do is about growth. It's about generating good returns for shareholders and LP. For the quarter, 18% ROE. We also originated 65% of our loans who are floating rate, 64% loan to value. And when you look at the overall portfolio of what's been done to date, delinquencies are only 2% which shows the strong credit culture of that business. On Sculptor, I gave you a few comments before. As the company we closed the transaction toward the end of November, if you think about it this way, December is a holiday month, getting through a little bit of transition stuff. So the partnership and working together has really been for about six months here. Very excited for the prospects of that business. A+ team, when you think about the folks that are running that business from the credit to the real estate side to the multi-strat teams, been around for 30-plus years. Again, it's not an AUM rate. It's about performing -- putting up great returns for shareholders and the LPs that support these businesses, and that's something we look forward to growing over time as performance continues to be very good. Q2 highlights, I mentioned the CLOs, closed two CLOs for $780 million. You'll see more activity in the CLO business as we go through here toward the end of the year. The real estate credit fund took in a $100 million of new capital, but this helps increase Sculptor's obviously long-term AUM, more importantly gives capital to invest in what we think is one of the best real estate, both lending and investment periods that we've seen in our careers. What I would say when you look at the overall platform on the real estate side, really no legacy like office, for example. And it puts us in a very, very unique position between the Sculptor real estate folks and some of the direct lending we're doing out of the Rithm commercial side. We have solutions for everybody and again, being that we're in what we believe is one of the best real estate investing period with fresh capital, no legacy issues on balance sheet, we're excited about where that business is going to go. Overall performance during Q2, as I pointed out earlier, was very, very strong. When you look at the Rithm, we have a slide in here on Page 16, Rithm on the commercial side. We pointed out, if you look to the right side of the page, Great Ajax. Great Ajax is a permanent capital vehicle that's externally managed by Rithm, very same team that built Rithm, formerly known as New Residential. Over the course of Q2, selling down legacy residential, reperforming loan assets, redeploying capital into the commercial world. Capital base today is about $250 million of equity. We look forward to growing that over time and I think the way that will likely occur is if there's some great investment or opportunities to deploy capital potentially raising capital, both in the public markets alongside with potentially some third-party capital that come in as well. A ton of experience around the house in all of our verticals, we will not enter something unless we have expertise there whether it be at the Sculptor level, whether it be at the Rithm level, whether it be commercial real estate, residential, consumer or any of the direct lending businesses. So overall, before -- I'll leave the segment performance. You could have a look at that yourselves, and we'll get into Q&A. But overall, very good quarter, very excited where the business is going. I'd really encourage you to take a look at some of Baron's comments. There are public company peers out there who have done a great job. Baron and the team have done a great job at the Newrez side as well. And again, honing in on performance first, AUM growth later, and driving returns for our LPs and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator, and we'll open it up for Q&A. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Eric Hagen with BTIG. Please go ahead. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Good morning. On the MSR portfolio, just given its growth, I mean, do we have an estimate for how much amortization you might incur going forward including on the excess MSRs that you bought during the quarter? And how are you feeling about the leverage in the MSR portfolio, do you feel like your capital allocation could maybe shift if rates drop sharply at either end of the yield curve going forward? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So let me -- you give me too many questions. But on the excess MSRs, these are legacy MSRs where we own the very same MSRs. It was the liquidation of an MSR fund -- it's very, very seasoned, probably something in the tune of 15-year season amortization will be very, very steady there. Those are really going back to our early thesis at new residential. These are credit impaired mortgage servicing rights, those are currently serviced just to give you a sense at Cooper. So it goes back to our relationship there as well. So -- and we have recaptured provisions with Cooper on that portfolio. On the amortization front, if you look at the slides, I think amortization came in roughly at 6 CPR. Here's what I would say on amortization, and this is more of a broader theme on the mortgage market. Current coupon mortgage rates are roughly 6.82%, home insurance is up probably 25% to 50% when you look on an annual basis. So when I think about those two things and I look at our MSR portfolio where 96% of our MSRs are added the money, call it gross WAC, roughly 4%, 282 basis points added the money on our MSRs. Yes, I'm worried about MSRs. I'm more worried about how we hedge them in MSR marks. I don't think you're going to have a huge refinancing market right now. We're not seeing that. We're not seeing a lot of turnover in our portfolio. I think when you look at the housing market, home prices yesterday, there was some more home price data that was released. Home prices are continuing to increase, although activity levels are down. So it's almost like -- I'm not sure why they're increasing quite frankly, so I do think something needs to give. But I don't see a robust origination market. The other thing I would say is today the capacity in the origination market is extremely high because production numbers I think for this year, we're going to -- I think we're estimating something around $1.6 trillion. I don't -- there's a lot of capacity. I don't see a lot of refinancing activity. I think there are headwinds against the refinancing activity. While saying all that, our recapture -- our focus on recapture, brand building, and everything else that's going on in the mortgage company is extremely high these days. So amortization, six, will increase if rates continue to rally here, but I don't see a huge move right now in the levels of refinancing activity we're going to see. As far as how we finance our business, great question. I -- we've been on the road for the course of the past kind of six weeks in multiple cities. We will be a more frequent issuer over time in the high-yield market relying less on some of the bank funding that we get. The other thing we'll likely do is we'll hit the capital markets with more securitizations around our MSR business. We've done that over the course of the years. So I feel good about where we are. One of the more important things I want to get out there is that there's no race for us as far as size in how we think about assets in the MSR world. Currently, I would tell you, we have everything we need. We see most opportunities that are put in front of us. The business will grow if we think the opportunity set creates a great return for shareholders and LPs. If not, we have plenty of other places we could deploy capital. I use the commercial real estate sector as an example, I brought up the Sculptor franchise as an example on this captive CLO equity fund. So looking at us, thinking about us in all these different direct lending businesses, being in the investment business, I think we feel very good about where we are in capital allocation, where we are from an overall financing perspective. You will see more high yield over time from us. That will pay down some of the secured financing, but we're excited again about telling our story. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Super thoughtful, thank you so much. What's the -- last one here, I mean, what's the growth outlook for Genesis, I mean do you feel like lower interest rates could catalyze a lot of new production there? And how much do you maybe expect to produce there, do you feel like you could allocate more capital over there over time? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes, the company has grown pretty substantially. This business, I will say, is a credit-first business. There are some new market participants that are entering the market who are fairly well capitalized. While saying that, our business is focused on some of the strongest sponsors, whether they be builders, whether they be folks that are renovating homes, whether they be bridge loans, some of the strongest sponsors in the business. We're going to continue with the credit-first business. So as long as credit performs, we'll grow. If credit doesn't perform or we're concerned about markets or headwinds and housings coming off, etc., that will drive, I think, the overall direction of the business. But we think the business could grow pretty substantially over time as there's a huge need in the direct lending space as the regional banks pull back. Eric Hagen -- Analyst Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you guys so much. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Eric. Operator The next question comes from Bose George with KBW. Please go ahead. Bose George -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Actually, I wanted to talk about Newrez. As you noted and as shown on Slide 5, some of the peers are valued very -- quite a bit higher than you are in the market. So for Newrez, I mean do you think that a listing is something that needs to be done to bridge that gap or kind of how are you thinking about that? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Bose, I knew you were going to ask that question. We get this -- this is something that's a recurring theme for us. We're working very closely internally as well as with our -- some of our external advisors, some of our banking friends on maximizing our capital structure so we get properly valued. I think the reason that we put in Slides 5 and 6 is really to show the value of the franchise. Having everything under the Rithm umbrella gives us a lot of flexibility. If you look at -- just to give you a sense, if you look at capital deployment in 2024, we've done -- from an asset perspective, I think we've acquired about $4.2 billion of assets. We've done a bunch of financing in and around the business. We put a little bit north of $1 billion of equity work, equity to work. What's going to end up happening is, one is, we want to illustrate the power of the franchise, and I think you see that in our numbers. And when you look at the mortgage company compared to others, obviously, it's very -- it's extremely undervalued or the overall franchise is undervalued. To Eric's questions around capital structure, you're going to see more high yield. Hopefully, that enables us to tell a better story around some of the financing stuff that we do. But in general, we are looking at anything and everything as a way to get our equity and our company performing in line with what I would call some of the pure-play mortgage players out there. If you look where we trade, we trade at, give or take, six times EBITDA something like, I think, coup in PFSI are nine times, just to give you a sense. Bose George -- Analyst And so just to sort of summarize, is it fair to say that listing remains an option, is that a fair statement? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I don't know if it's just a direct listing or something. But yes, I mean, again, it's -- we're looking at anything and everything as a way to increase value for shareholders. Bose George -- Analyst OK. Great. And then actually just one more on Newrez. The $2.7 billion of book value that you show on Slide 5, so is that allocating all of the corporate debt to Newrez, is that how you get from the $4 billion of book value down to that level? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes, it is, Bose. It's allocation of the corporate sector. Bose George -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Bose. Operator The next question comes from Stephen Laws with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Stephen Laws -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Baron, can you touch on volumes and market share, a strong quarter, particularly in corresponding. Can you talk about outlook back half of the year into 2025, rates seem to be coming down, what channels do you expect to drive growth and kind of -- I don't know if you have market share targets, I know it's dependent on margins, but can you talk about your outlook for continued growth on the origination side? Baron Silverstein -- President, NewRez We don't really have a target for where we're basically looking at from a market share perspective. We look at the markets and we take advantage of where we feel like we have the best return for the company overall. And correspondent today has been the best place for us to basically have the best overall return, best profitability. And then we've really been able to kind of drive the business there. And we talked about that in the first quarter. Second quarter, actually, we were able to drive additional market share in wholesale. And while we did give up margin from where we were in the first quarter, we were very happy with kind of how we were able to position ourselves overall from our market share growth going into the second quarter. Our core focus, really, as Michael talked about it as well, is given the size of our servicing portfolio is really kind of expanding our brand, being there for our customers, improving our customer experience. And then we believe we can gain significant market share without actually going out to the market overall by just continuing to offer better products for our customers overall. And that's how we kind of evaluate the business today versus necessarily having a target as to where we think the market is headed. Stephen Laws -- Analyst Thanks, Baron. Michael, can you talk about the Sculptor business, AUM revenue was up a pretty good bit sequentially. I believe performance fees typically occur end of year. So kind of can you talk about what drove that sequential increase and how we think about that line moving forward? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think it's going to be -- again, it's -- this is more of what I would say is of a growth story or a rebuilding of the so-called growth story. Again, it's -- so I think what you saw in the quarter is in some off-cycle realizations of some prior investments across the platform. But again, it's going to be lumpy and that's truly just the nature of that business until you grow real AUM that's generating fee-related earnings. So the way I would think about it is a little bit of off-cycle realizations, shows the power honestly of good investments within the overall Sculptor franchise, but it will be episodic over time. Stephen Laws -- Analyst Thanks. And lastly, I think the Series A and B for us float this quarter or back half of the year. Any thoughts to taking those out or how you think about managing your -- that part of the capital stack in the coming months? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So one of the things when you look at our business overall, whether it be at the mortgage company, whether it be at the bond portfolio, the mortgage company, for example, could have -- just using rough math, $10 billion to $15 billion of escrow deposits. If the Fed cuts rates, SOFR is 5.33, we get paid for SOFR or SOFR plus a fee on our deposits that we have with the large banks. So if you think about it this way, those are floating rate. I think $400 million is resetting now. But at some point, we'll take those out, quite frankly. But for now, I think they'll likely stay there as the markets -- as the yield curve steepens and the Fed cuts rates, we'll either do an exchange offer or come back to market to take those out over time. But the point is, if you look at the broad business model and how we think about duration and how we think about hedging, this is just one piece of the overall pie. The other thing, just a quick note on hedging, we're not going to fight the Fed here. We've added a significant amount of hedge to our MSR portfolios where I would -- where we could tell you that the overall protection of that book is probably at the highest level that we've seen in years. When the Fed was raising rates, quite frankly, we were biased the other way for higher rates and short the bond market, here we're neutral right now. So just to give you a little bit more color on the hedging strategy. Stephen Laws -- Analyst Right. Thanks guys. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Crispin Love with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Crispin Love -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just looking at Sculptor and building on a previous question there. So it shows solid profitability. Revenues improved, comp expense was down over about 15% or so. Can you discuss what drove comp lower in the quarter for asset management, whether it was seasonal, not from the first quarter? And then can you just size the crystallization in the second quarter? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So the comp numbers typically hit in the fourth quarter, and you'll see more -- most likely you see probably more realizations in the fourth quarter. During the second quarter, I think we saw realizations of $50 million. So what you'll see is, again, it's -- you're going to see more comp expenses hit in the fourth quarter. You'll probably see more realizations in the fourth quarter. For this quarter, it's like I mentioned, it is an off-cycle period where you're seeing realizations on some of the investments across the broader platform. Hopefully, that's helpful. Crispin Love -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst That is helpful, thanks Michael. And then just on the Newrez side, you did mention earlier, you don't expect to see a refi market in the near term. But can you discuss at what level of mortgage rates you might need to get to, to drive refis for you and then how you could take advantage of that on a recapture perspective when we do get there? Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So here's what I'd say. If our gross WACs are 4%, you got a 6.82% mortgage rate. You got home insurance costs higher, and you got a -- the numbers yesterday, I think it's $35 trillion with the expectation that there will be a couple of trillion dollars of issuance coming to the treasury market. I still think while the curve -- we do believe the curve is going to steepen out and that the Fed will likely lower rates here in September. I don't know where long REITs ultimately go. So I'm probably less bullish on the origination market maybe or we are more so than others. I think the one thing to keep in mind and the prior question asking Baron about the correspondent business, the mortgage origination business, when you really, really break it down is not that profitable. Retaining the customer is and keeping that MSR, so you have cash flow is important. So if we break it down and think about one unit of somebody that took out a 7% mortgage and mortgage rates go to 6%, and you want to refi that person, and you're competing against every other mortgage banker out there, really think about the real origination gain you're going to see. I'm probably less constructive on origination gains than others. I am doing this for a long period of time. I do think if you got into a so-called COVID-like scenario, if you're going to play that and you think that the refi market will pick up, then it could become a capacity issue where you're able to drive more outsized origination gains. But when you look and you think about some of the best in the business, whether they be at the wholesale side, whether it be at the correspondent side, and we're pretty large players in the correspondent side. I think in general, the market is going to remain extremely competitive on the origination side. And the main thing for us to do is to try to keep our customers and keep the cash flow from the MSR side. And just -- those are just my thoughts on the origination market and where we think about origination gains. Keep in mind, the other thing I'd point out, when you think about the correspondent business, you're buying a closed loan. So you buy a closed loan, you deliver it to the agencies, and then you just capitalize your MSR. So you have to think about what that advantage you're going to have in the correspondent business as well. So it's a pretty competitive market. Crispin Love -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thanks. Very helpful and appreciate you taking my questions. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] The next question comes from Trevor Cranston with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead. Trevor Cranston -- Analyst Hey. Thanks. Follow-up question on the servicing portfolio and potential for refi. Obviously, the weighted average WAC is pretty far out of the money on the servicing book. But do you guys have any statistics on sort of how much of the MSR is in higher rate mortgages or close to current coupons and what the scale of the recapture opportunity could be in a potential rally of rate scenario? Thanks. Baron Silverstein -- President, NewRez Yes. So we have approximately $100 billion notional, with a coupon of 6% and above. Trevor Cranston -- Analyst Got it. OK. On the commercial real estate opportunity, can you guys maybe dive into a little bit how you see that playing out in terms of potentially adding some investment to Rithm balance sheet versus doing that in other funds or through the Great Ajax vehicle? Thanks. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So on the Great Ajax side, what we've been doing recently is buying AAA CMBS which when you put a turn of leverage on, it looks like it's a teens-type returns versus in that vehicle before where you had kind of reperforming and nonperforming loans. And if you think about it, if you're a dividend payer, you got -- you're really not getting a lot of cash flow. The coupons there were big discounts and here, we're generating cash flow assets. When you look at the real estate opportunity, the Sculptor guys are best-in-class. I mean, they've done a fantastic job in creating great returns for their LPs for 20-plus years. The team has been together. The leadership there has been together for 20-plus years. Big focus on what I would say, real estate private equity more niche-type investing over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks, more capital coming in now on the credit side there as well. When you look at the Rithm balance sheet, it's small. We don't have a large amount of capital outstanding. We have, all of us that have been doing this for a long period of time, have a ton of relationships with different folks in the business. But what you'll see off the Rithm balance sheet is more of a direct lending business today, not competing with anything on other sides of the house. At some point, maybe you do stuff together. But for now, I would look at Rithm as more direct lending of the balance sheet. At some point, we'll have partners as well, and Sculptor is really a funds business with all third-party capital with, quite frankly, best-in-class from an overall investment professional standpoint. Trevor Cranston -- Analyst OK. Makes sense. Thank you. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Nierenberg for any closing remarks. Michael Nierenberg -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, thanks for the questions. Have a great rest of the summer. Have a look at our deck. I do think there's some good information in there and always happy to do follow up with everybody. Thanks so much.

    "title": "HealthLynked Corp. Announces Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2024 Results with Strategic Restructuring, Third-Party Debt Repayment, and Core Technology Focus",
    "text": "NAPLES, Fla., Nov. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN – HealthLynked Corp. ( OTCQB: HLYK ), a leader in healthcare networking and technology innovation, today announced financial results for the three- and nine-months ending Sept. 30, 2024. With a renewed commitment to profitable growth, HealthLynked has restructured its clinical operations, reduced its third-party debt obligations, reduced physical plant cost and shifted focus toward its core software solutions, positioning the company for enhanced operational efficiency and scalability in the future. Financial Highlights Revenue: HealthLynked reported revenue of $0.59 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 56% decrease year-over-year from $1.33 million in Q3 2023 and a 26% sequential decline from $0.80 million in Q2 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, revenue totaled $2.39 million, a 12% drop from the preceding nine-month period (October 2023 to June 2024) and a 50% decrease from $4.79 million in the first nine months of 2023. This decline is primarily due to expected clinical revenue disruption resulting from our restructuring efforts related to onboarding of new clinical staffing, consolidating clinical locations and other right-sizing efforts. Expense Reductions: HealthLynked reduced practice operating expenses by $0.50 million, or 39%, in Q3 2024 to $0.80 million, compared to $1.30 million in Q3 2023. Year-to-date, expenses decreased by 38%, underscoring the company's continued focus on efficiency. Overall, total operating expenses fell by 10% in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and by 19% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Loss from Operations: The loss from operations for Q3 2024 was increased by $0.49 million. From $1.18 million, to $1.67 million loss in Q3 2023. Year-to-date, the loss from operations was $3.93 million, representing a 29% increase over the $3.04 million loss in the same period of 2023. Net Income/Loss: HealthLynked reported a net loss of $1.97 million in Q3 2024, compared to a net loss of $0.17 million in Q3 2023. This difference was primarily attributable to a $1.08 million gain in 2023 related to the sale of ACO Health Partners. For the first nine months of 2024, the net loss was $4.90 million, contrasting with a net income of $0.27 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to $3.76 million gains related to the ACO Health Partners sale recorded in 2023. Strategic Outlook HealthLynked remains committed to expanding its footprint through strategic partnerships and a growing user base. The company is shifting its focus from traditional clinical operations to app-based services, aiming to increase both user acquisition and revenue through innovative digital solutions. By leveraging its patient-centric network, HealthLynked anticipates significant growth in its membership base, enhancing healthcare accessibility for patients and providers alike. HealthLynked's software platform's cost is significantly lower than the variable costs associated with operating clinical services. This shift allows HealthLynked to minimize the fluctuations in costs and revenue that typically accompany clinic operations, resulting in a leaner, more efficient business model. CEO Contribution and Financial Support Dr. Michael Dent, CEO of HealthLynked, has played a crucial role in providing the necessary financial support for the company's operations during this period of transition, with $2.7 million in debt funded so far in 2024. His commitment has enabled HealthLynked to navigate this restructuring phase successfully, setting a foundation for future growth as the company benefits from reduced third-party debt service and an optimized cost structure. Executive Commentary Dr. Michael Dent, CEO of HealthLynked, stated, \"Our restructuring efforts in our clinical operations are designed to maximize profitability and support our transition toward core technology solutions. With telemedicine services just now available in all 50 states and our paid concierge services gaining traction, HealthLynked is well-positioned to drive revenues by focusing on the value of our patient-centric software platform. This shift allows us to better serve patients and providers across the nation, reducing operational overhead while expanding our reach and impact in healthcare.\" About HealthLynked HealthLynked Corp. is dedicated to improving global community health.

    "text": "Start Time: 09:00 January 1, 0000 9:17 AM ET Oxford Lane Capital Corporation ( NASDAQ: OXLC ) Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call July 26, 2024, 09:00 AM ET Company Participants Jonathan Cohen - CEO Bruce Rubin - CFO Saul Rosenthal - President Joe Kupka - Managing Director Conference Call Participants Mickey Schleien - Ladenburg Erik Zwick - Lucid Capital Markets Operator Hello all, and welcome to Oxford Lane Capital Corp's First Fiscal Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Lydia, and I will be your operator today. After the prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now hand you over to Jonathan Cohen, CEO, to begin. Jonathan Cohen Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Oxford Lane Capital Corp. First Fiscal Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Saul Rosenthal, our President; Bruce Rubin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Kupka, our Managing Director. Bruce, could you open the call with a disclosure regarding forward-looking statements. Bruce Rubin Sure, Jonathan. Today's conference call is being recorded. An audio replay of the call will be available for 30 days. Replay information is included in our press release that was issued earlier this morning. Please note that this call is the property of Oxford Lane Capital Corp. Any unauthorized rebroadcast of this call in any form is strictly prohibited. At this point, please direct your attention to the customary disclosure in this morning's press release regarding forward-looking information. Today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and projections that reflect the company's current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. We ask that you refer to our most recent filings with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these projections. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements unless required to do so by law. During this call, we will use terms defined in the earnings release and also refer to non-GAAP measures. For definitions and reconciliations to GAAP, please refer to our earnings release posted on our website at www.oxfordlanecapital.com. And with that, I'll turn the presentation back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Cohen Thank you, Bruce. On June 30, 2024, our net asset value per share stood at $4.91 compared to a net asset value per share of $4.90 as of the prior quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $89.8 million, representing an increase of approximately $7.1 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income consisted of approximately $84 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments and approximately $5.7 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. Oxford Lane recorded GAAP net investment income of approximately $56 million or $0.22 per share for the quarter ended June compared to approximately $51 million or $0.22 per share for the quarter ended March 31. Our core net investment income was approximately $107.2 million or $0.41 per share for the quarter ended June 30 compared with approximately $79.9 million or $0.35 per share for the quarter ended March 31. For the quarter ended June, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $14.4 million and net realized gains of approximately $6.1 million. We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $47.7 million or $0.18 per share for the first fiscal quarter. As of June 30, the following metrics applied. We note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 17.4%, up from 17.1% as of March 31. The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.8%, down from 16.9% as of March 31. The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 26.9%, up from 23.5% as of March 31. We note that the cash distribution yields calculated on our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period end. During the quarter ended June, we issued a total of approximately 45.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $242.1 million. During the quarter ended June, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $216.9 million, and we received approximately $96.3 million from sales and from repayments. On July 25th, our Board of Directors declared monthly common stock distributions of $0.09 per share for each of the months ending October, November and December of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Managing Director, Joe Kupka. Joe? Joe Kupka Thanks, Jonathan. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the U.S. loan market price index opened at 96.73%, reaching 96.99% in mid-May before softening in June and ending the quarter at 96.59%. The decrease in U.S. loan prices led to an approximate 2-point decrease in median U.S. CLO equity net asset values. Additionally, due to elevated levels of repricing activity, we observed median weighted average spreads across loan pools within CLO portfolios decreased to 361 basis points compared to 368 basis points last quarter. The 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index decreased to 0.9% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 1.1% at the end of March 2024. We note that out-of-court restructuring exchanges and subpar buybacks, which are not captured in the side the default rate remain elevated. Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as the percentage of loans with a price below 80% of par, ended the quarter at 4.4% compared to approximately 3.5% at the end of March. CLO new issuance during the quarter totalled approximately $53 billion, an increase of $4 billion from the prior quarter, marking the second highest quarterly volume in CLO market history as CLO liabilities have continued to tighten. Oxford Lane remained active this quarter, trading over 500 million notional CLO equity and junior debt while participating in opportunistic resets and refinancing's. As a function of our overall activity during the quarter, we were able to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio from July 2026 to November 2026. Our investment strategy during the quarter was to engage in relative value trading and seek to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio. In the current market environment, we intend to continue to utilize our opportunistic and unconstrained CLO investment strategy across U.S. CLO equity, debt and warehouses as we look to maximize our long-term total return. And as a permanent capital vehicle, we have historically been able to take a longer-term view towards our investment strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan. Jonathan Cohen Thanks, Joe. Additional information about Oxford Lane's first quarter results has been uploaded to our website at www.oxfordlanecapital.com. And with that, the operator will now poll for any questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Mickey Schleien with Ladenburg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mickey Schleien Yes. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan, there's been a leveraged loan repricing wave with over one-third of the market trading above par and due to higher expectations of a soft landing. That trend can impact loan spreads and I do see that the average spread in your CLO equity portfolio declined 8 basis points, which can pressure the CLO equity arbitrage. And I also see that your average AAA liability spreads were about stable. So what caused your CLO cash yields to increase so much this quarter? Joe Kupka Hi Mickey, so a lot of that was due to -- so you're looking at the January versus April payments. So there's a bit of lag in those numbers. So we've seen managers continue to build spread up till this quarter. The July payments did take a dip down from the April payments. So you'll continue to see that repricing wave hit. So there's a lag there. Additionally, we did have some first-time payments come on, which bolstered that cash yield number for this quarter. Mickey Schleien Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And what are your expectations for the remaining ability to refinance or reset liabilities in your CLO equity portfolio to help, defend yields against the loan spread compression we're seeing? Jonathan Cohen Sure Mickey. We really don't make public projections or pronouncements about those kinds of forward-looking activities. But certainly, we see the state of the CLO liability market, which looks to be generally constructive still. Mickey Schleien Okay. And Jonathan, the ratings agencies haven't seemed to accept the higher odds of the soft landing or the amount of capital available to lower quality borrowers. So the downgrade upgrade ratio is still meaningfully above 1x, which can pressure CCC buckets. So how are your portfolio managers dealing with that trend? Joe Kupka Yes. So one data point we've seen is actually just due to the elevated amount of reset activity. Managers have been proactively cleaning up these CCC baskets in anticipation of looking to reset into a cleaner deal. So we've seen CCC baskets in that sense, declining a bit. But you're right, it's going to be a continuing battle for these managers to proactively manage around these CCC baskets, but they do have healthy OC cushions even if they do bump up against the limit, VOC ratios are still remaining relatively healthy. Mickey Schleien Yes I saw that. And my last question on the balance sheet. The fund doesn't carry particularly high leverage even with the recent notes offering. So what's your appetite to issue additional debt or preferred shares to help lower your weighted average cost of capital? Jonathan Cohen Our appetite Mickey, is at this moment principally predicated on pricing. So to the extent that we think there's a sufficiently robust arbitrage available to us, we would look to add additional -- selectively looked at additional debt, but only at pricing that we found to be compelling. Mickey Schleien Okay. Any sort of target leverage that you have in mind, Jonathan? Jonathan Cohen Not that we've shared with the world at large no. Mickey Schleien Okay. Those are all my questions this morning. Thank you. Jonathan Cohen Thank you Mickey very much. Operator Our next question is from Erik Zwick with Lucid Capital Markets. Your line is open. Erik Zwick Good morning, everyone. I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to start with a question on just -- on the sales and repayment activity during the quarter. Was it the highest that we've seen in over the past 5. So I'm just wondering if that's reflective of market activity or some portfolio specific factors? Jonathan Cohen I think it's largely Erik a function -- or significantly a function of just the size of the fund that has grown substantially over the course of the last year or two. So larger scale begets more repayment activity and more sales activity. We have been and remain committed to running an actively managed portfolio which should generate significant trading activity. You saw we did about $500 million worth of notional CLO trading in the quarter, but I wouldn't call that either unusual or necessarily unprecedented. Erik Zwick Thanks for the color there. And just with regard to the quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses. Any color you can provide there whether there was anything kind of onetime in nature or just kind of a more kind of normal inflationary creep here? Jonathan Cohen Are you referencing a percentage-based increase Erik or a dollar-based increase? Erik Zwick A dollar-based increase if I recall correctly I can... Jonathan Cohen Just the size of the fund -- most likely just the size of the fund. We raised an enormous amount of capital not only this quarter, but in the immediately preceding quarter. So everything else was constant that would likely lead to that dollar-denominated number being higher. Erik Zwick And then a question just on credit. You mentioned that out-of-court restructurings remain elevated. You've seen some increase in this distressed prices in the market as well. Looking at your industry exposure you have a view into a broad slice of the U.S. economy. I guess are there any areas where you're seeing any stress or weakness? It seems like the odds of a soft landing recession are becoming more probable at this point, but there's still I think some concerns in certain areas. So I guess from the ability that you have to look into your portfolio are there any areas where you see some stress at this point and if so how are you seeking to manage that? Jonathan Cohen Nothing Erik that is readily apparent outside of sort of the perception in the mainstream right now about economic activity. I think there's continued concern within the U.S. economy about consumer behavior, the state of the consumer. There's an ongoing question mark around certain parts of the economy that we're aware of sensitive to. But in terms of the perspective that we've got on the U.S. economy as a result of the investing that we do, I don't think that we've got an insight that isn't sort of outside of the popular perception. Erik Zwick Excellent. That’s all for me today. Thanks for taking my question. Jonathan Cohen Thank you Erik very much. Operator Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue. So I'll now turn the call back to Jonathan Cohen for any closing comments. Jonathan Cohen Thank you all. We appreciate your interest and your time today on this conference call. And we certainly look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you all very much for participating. Operator This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

He Lifeng is one of China's four vice premiers, and heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's economic and finance committee. \"The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington. The Trump Team,\" said Peter Alexander, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng has met with several U.S. finance executives in the last month as Beijing seeks to build relationships ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's planned tariffs on China . > 24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are He Lifeng is one of China's four vice premiers, and heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's economic and finance committee. He met with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink in Beijing on Dec. 5 , and Goldman Sachs President and COO John E. Waldron on Dec. 4 , according to state media. That followed a meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on Nov. 21 , state media said. \"The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington. The Trump Team,\" said Peter Alexander, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. \"Back channeling is how China operates, even prefers, when building lines of communications.\" Goldman Sachs said it was aware of the reports. The two other financial firms did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. Trump has filled his Cabinet picks with at least 10 reported billionaires , including two with a finance-heavy background: hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for treasury secretary and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for commerce secretary . Money Report Insurance stocks have fallen since UnitedHealthcare CEO killing Stock futures are little changed as investors brace for key inflation data: Live updates \"I do think the Wall Street folks that are coming into commerce and treasury will serve a moderating role on the trade protectionist side,\" said Clark Packard, research fellow at the Cato Institute. \"It's all relative because I do think there's going to be something protectionist on the trade side. Those voices will be the voices that work to mitigate some of that.\" \"Especially at Treasury they're pretty worried about market reaction,\" Packard said. \"The one thing that can truly maybe scare Trump away from a really aggressive [policy] would be the market reaction.\" U.S. stocks are on track for a relatively rare second straight year of more than 20% gains . After tumbling early this year, Chinese stocks rebounded after Beijing signaled a shift toward stimulus in late September. Chinese authorities on Monday affirmed that supportive stance in a high-level meeting . With actions such as hosting Wall Street executives and imposing export controls on critical minerals, Beijing is keeping its options open, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, who is Maurice R. Greenberg senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"They are preparing for the worst-case scenario.\" But she cautioned that it's unlikely that financial institutions can do much to mitigate tariffs and tensions with the U.S. \"Business transactions and Wall Street executives, one way or another, they would not give up opportunities in any market as long as it fits into their profile,\" Liu said. Chinese financial media summarized He Lifeng's meetings with the U.S. executives as sending a signal on Beijing's willingness to open up the financial sector and attract long-term, foreign institutional investment . Foreign capital inflows are often cast by Chinese state media as a symbol of support for the domestic market. The Chinese vice premier also met with Invesco President and CEO Andrew Schlossberg in Beijing on Nov. 12 , and HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker on Nov. 14 , according to state media. HSBC said it had nothing to add to the report. Invesco did not respond to a request for comment. U.S.-China capital markets have been \"arguably the most dynamic and inter-connected aspect\" of the bilateral relationship in the last two decades, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. \"When the cross-border finance relationship is constructive and cooperative, it could lead to MAP, i.e. mutual assured [prosperity] ; otherwise it will be MAD, mutual assured destruction ,\" Ma said, referring to a Cold War deterrence principle.

    "text": "TSX and OTC: MPVD TORONTO , Oct. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. (\" Mountain Province \", the \"Company\") (TSX: MPVD) (OTC: MPVD) today announces production and sales results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (\"the Quarter\" or \"Q3 2024\") from the Gahcho Kué Diamond Mine (\"GK Mine\"). All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Q3 2024 Production Takeaways ( all figures are reported on a 100% basis unless otherwise stated ) 1,187,912 carats recovered, 10% less than Quarter 3 2023 (Q3 2023: 1,326,160 carats) Average grade of 1.24 carats per tonne, 18% less than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 1.51 carats per tonne) 923,814 ore tonnes mined, 4% more than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 887,695 ore tonnes mined) 961,371 ore tonnes treated, 10% more than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 877,617 tonnes treated) Q3 2024 Production Figures 2024 Q3 2023 Q3 YoY Variance Total tonnes mined (ore and waste) 8,603,369 9,145,849 -6 % Ore tonnes mined 923,814 887,695 4 % Ore tonnes treated 961,371 877,617 10 % Carats recovered 1,187,912 1,326,160 -10 % Carats recovered (49% share) 582,077 649,818 -10 % Recovered grade (carats per tonne) 1.24 1.51 -18 % Q3 2024 Sales Results During the Quarter, 679,599 carats were sold for total proceeds of $69.4 million ( US$50.8 million ), resulting in an average price of $102 per carat ( US$75 per carat). These results compare to Q3 2023 when 478,653 carats were sold for total proceeds of $60 .2 million ( US$45.3 million ), resulting in an average price of $126 per carat ( US$95 per carat). Mark Wall , the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Q3 was again a positive quarter for the metric of tonnes treated with another robust performance in the processing plant, with grade also performing slightly better than plan. Q3 and Q4 were planned to have a lower grade than the first half of the year due to a higher percentage of lower grade Tuzo ore in the process mix. On the mining side the Hearne pit bottom mining is well progressed, and the open pit mining of Hearne will finish during Q4 of this year. The mining of the lower portions of the 5034 pit is also progressing, with some geotechnical challenges and higher than expected rainfall events slowing down mining, in some areas. The work to strip down to the NEX orebody has started with this pit expected to be a significant contributor to production in the second half of 2025. Work to sequence the plan between the finish of the 5034 pit and waste stripping to the NEX orebody remains in progress. 2024 Production guidance of 4.2 - 4.7 million carats recovered is maintained, with production currently expected to finish in the mid to upper portion of the guidance range. Total tonnes mined is expected to finish lower than the bottom of guidance of 36 million tonnes, with ore tonnes mined expected to finish above the top of guidance of 4.6 million ore tonnes and ore tonnes treated close to the upper end of guidance.\" Reid Mackie , Vice President of Diamond Sales and Marketing, commented: \"The rough diamond market during Q3 was unsettled by continued price decreases announced by leading polished diamond price indices. This was compounded by reports of delayed polished buying by downstream retailers and precipitated sales of polished stock by the industry midstream. Many rough producers addressed this by cancelling or delaying their rough diamond sales during the third quarter. For Mountain Province , which held its usual two scheduled sales during the quarter, prices achieved were largely stable.

    "text": "MUNICH (Reuters) -Volkswagen's truck unit Traton set out five-year targets during its Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, as it expects to benefit from the shift towards electrification and plans to raise the share of battery electric vehicles in its sales. European truckmakers need to increase the share of electric trucks in their sales by 50% to meet the European Union's carbon emissions reduction targets by 2030 or face stiff fines. \"Our brands have future-proofed their product portfolio by investing in the electrification of commercial vehicles,\" Traton's CEO Christian Levin said in a statement. Truckmakers have called for a faster build-up of charging stations in Europe in an appeal to governments to provide the infrastructure necessary to make e-trucks profitable. The group sees its return on sales rising to 9-11% by 2029 from the current 8-9% and anticipates revenue to grow by 20-40% over the next five years. The company, which owns the Scania, MAN, and Volkswagen Trucks and Buses brands, also plans to fully repay its debt over the period. In addition, it intends to increase its market share in North America, a key sales driver for the truckmaker, and manage its business there more effectively, starting with the renaming of its US unit Navistar to International Motors as of Tuesday.

    "title": "Opinion: Nation’s political left eagerly stokes outrage and anger",
    "text": "Details are still emerging about the attempt to kill Donald Trump — about the shooter and how it was possible, and also what it says about America. The first is obvious: Political violence has no place in America. No matter our politics, Americans should never resort to violence to settle our differences. We may have many differences, but the only answer is speech, speech, and more speech. Except, those on the political left don’t believe that for a second, not after years of Big Tech censorship and other anti-speech activities. For eight years, leftist political leaders and cultural elites have done nothing but stoke outrage and anger, encouraging increased lawlessness and hate. Anti-Trumpism — “Orange Man Bad” — has become a religion with crazed, fanatical adherents. The “crying liberal” meme from January 2017 personified millions of people in this country. What happened in Butler, Pa. — with one victim dead and two critically injured — was not an isolated act. It didn’t just happen out of the blue, without rhyme or reason. It is the latest in a long list of examples of leftist violence meant to silence Republicans and tear apart America’s social fabric. The examples are endless. The 2020 “Black Lives Matter” riots across 140 cities ended up costing the economy billions of dollars, thousands of damaged businesses, and dozens of lost lives. Radical Antifa activists claimed entire neighborhoods in once-great cities like Portland and Seattle, declaring “autonomous zones” free of police intervention and other government oversight. And the Democrats in power refused to act, cheering them on. Then there are the pro-Hamas protests tearing apart colleges and universities, with rioters preaching antisemitism and promoting a terrorist group at the expense of law and order. Once again, left-wing administrators refused to act. Are we honestly surprised that a former president who has been called a Nazi, fascist and war criminal happened to be shot while giving a stump speech? Is it shocking that a man denounced as “evil” time and time again became target practice by someone who saw absolutely no consequences — and no small amount of glorification — for outrageously violent leftism? Of course not. If any good-faith actors are on the left, now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to hold radicals accountable for the political violence that has reached such a boiling point rather than encouraging and rewarding bad conduct. If the “temperature” is to drop, that clearly needs to start with the anti-Trump crowd. It’s the most basic lesson: If you punish bad action, you get less of it. If you don’t, you get more. And, if you reward it, you get way more. Consider the debacle on our southern border, with the Biden administration refusing to take illegal immigration seriously and states subsidizing illegals with more money than we spend on our homeless and veterans. When you don’t punish unlawful activity and go so far as to encourage it to win votes, you get millions of migrants coming to America with no checks and balances. Where is their incentive to stop? Related Articles Schools that punish disruptive protesters with expulsion don’t get more disruptive protesters. Rioters don’t riot where they will be shot. Conversely, when bad behavior is encouraged by radicals in faculty or other leadership positions, the bad guys tear down more to get their way. Today’s left has abandoned our most basic principles — personal responsibility, civil discourse and social tolerance — while ramping up the vitriol about “literal Hitler” and “words are violence” over today’s progressive mental disorder du jour. And so, we get more political violence. The temperature isn’t too hot in America; it’s too hot on the left. Until the left takes responsibility for that and stops coddling the mob, there will only be more and more political violence — until the next horrific event.",

The RSI is below 40, meaning it may be oversold. This suggests the price could start climbing soon. The current price is near the support level at $1.29, where buyers often enter the market. The Simple Moving Average over the past 100 days is around $1.53, close to the current price, which aligns with long-term trends. If the price bounces from support, it might break the resistance at $2.32. Passing this level could lead to $2.83, a gain of over 30%. With altcoin season coming, FET could grow significantly. Chill Guy: Embracing Calm in a Chaotic World Through a Laid-Back Meme Chill Guy is a new meme character known for his super relaxed and carefree attitude. He embodies a \"lowkey\" vibe—calm, casual, and unbothered by life's challenges. In illustrations, he appears laid-back, wearing a grey sweater, blue jeans, and red shoes, smirking with his hands in his pockets. This demeanor has resonated on platforms like TikTok, where users praise him as the best new meme character for his cool, \"whatever\" attitude. The Chill Guy movement seeks to spread the art of staying chill in a chaotic world, helping individuals discover mindfulness and inner peace. While there is enthusiasm around the character, any associated coin or technology is speculative, and its potential in the current market cycle remains uncertain. Uniswap's UNI Token: Governance and Potential in Decentralized Finance Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol. Its UNI token, launched in September 2020, lets holders vote on changes to the platform, like fee structures and token distribution. In response to competition from SushiSwap, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, giving 400 tokens to each, worth over $1,000 at launch. This move aimed to encourage loyalty. Uniswap's open-source nature and free token listing set it apart from centralized exchanges. As one of the largest DeFi platforms with over $3 billion in assets, the UNI token holds potential and may be attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion In the current bull run, while BOME, CATSLAP, CHILLGUY, and UNI may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it aims to bring financial freedom to all. Catzilla invites everyone to join the fight against crypto villains.

    "title": "Tim Hortons' parent company inks two deals to bolster presence in China",
    "text": "TORONTO - Restaurant Brands International says it's spending up to $45 million on two deals intended to boost its presence in China and spur growth in what the company sees as a promising market. The parent company behind Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Firehouse Subs says the first deal will see it acquire Popeyes China from Tims China, which operates Tim Hortons franchises in the country. RBI values the purchase at $15 million, noting Popeyes China has opened 14 restaurants in Shanghai since initially launching in August 2023. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App The Toronto-based company says it plans to work with local partners and establish a \"master franchisee\" model for Popeyes similar to what is in place in other countries. RBI also says it plans to partner with Cartesian Capital to invest up to $50 million in Tims China via three-year convertible notes, of which it will receive up to $30 million. The moves come months after the company announced it would need to ramp up spending in China to propel further growth, and executives are striking an optimistic tone about the potential for expansion in the country. \"China is one of the most compelling long-term market opportunities for both our Popeyes and Tim Hortons brands. Popeyes China is off to a strong start and we are excited to unlock its development potential,\" Asia Pacific President Rafael Odorizzi said in a statement. \"... Today's announcement allows Tims China to redouble its focus on quality restaurant development and providing Chinese consumers with our high-quality Tims coffee and food offerings.\" The investment in Tims China will grant RBI the right to appoint two directors to the Board and will see its equity ownership in the business increase to up to 18%, the company said. RBI was sounding a cautionary note about expansion in China just five months ago, when it used the release of its fourth-quarter financial results to soften its outlook for the region. RBI had once expected net restaurant growth -- a metric that takes into account locations both opening and closing -- to climb by at least five per cent between 2023 and 2024. \"A key factor to delivering this level of growth was our expectation that our development in China would accelerate in 2024 off of 2023 levels,\" RBI chief executive Joshua Kobza told analysts in February. \"We now believe that outlook is less certain and have updated our outlook to reflect a lower level of net unit additions in China this year.\" The company said at the time it expects its consolidated global net restaurant growth in the mid-four per cent range this year before accelerating in 2025. The prediction came amid a drop in consumer spending in China, which has seen an economic slowdown in recent years. Disruptions and job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with falling prices for homes -- a staple form of investment for most Chinese families -- have left many Chinese unwilling or unable to spend, sapping the economy of another major driver of business activity. But RBI remained bullish about its prospects in the Chinese market. Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp \"We have a strong belief in China as an attractive growth market for our brands,\" Kobza said on the earnings call. \"Given the incredible geographic scope and population of the market, success there requires a serious long-term capital commitment from our partners, a long-term time horizon and a commitment to grow the brand in the face of tough competition.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 1, 2024. -- With files from Tara Deschamps and The Associated Press.",

    "title": "BP: No Thanks, I'm Buying American",
    "text": "JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Introduction Three things are certain in life: Death. Taxes. European oil stocks underperform their American peers. While I'm obviously joking a bit, it is widely known that European energy majors don't have the valuation multiples their American peers enjoy. Using the forward P/E ratio metric, we see the three Americans, Exxon Mobil ( XOM ), Chevron ( CVX ), and ConocoPhillips ( COP ), are trading all at 12x NTM earnings. The European giants, BP ( NYSE: BP ) , Shell ( SHEL ), and TotalEnergies ( TTE ), all trade at 9x or less. Data by YCharts In this article, I'll zoom in on BP. I covered the company in an article on November 24, titled; \"Despite Its Valuation, BP Remains A Hard Pass For Me.\" Since then, shares have gone nowhere, pressured by new negative headlines that I will discuss in this article. So, as we have a lot to discuss, let's get right to it! BP Isn't Offering What The Market Wants The biggest reason American and European oil stocks are trading at two very different valuations can be summarized in one sentence: European companies are more prone to ESG-related diversification. Or, to put it differently, the European oil majors have a much bigger focus on non-oil operations, which most have done in response to political/social pressures to make their businesses more sustainable. This is what it says on the Wikipedia page of BP: In 2001, in response to negative press on British Petroleum's poor safety standards, the company adopted a green sunburst logo and rebranded itself as BP (\"Beyond Petroleum\") plc. - Wikipedia The problem - for BP - is that market participants do not want to go \"beyond petroleum.\" They are buying big oil for a reason. Especially after the pandemic, it became slowly obvious that the energy transition was not going to put an end to oil and gas demand growth. Even the sustainability-focused International Energy Agency, which I consider to be often too pessimistic, does not expect peak demand in oil until at least 2030. Despite the slowdown in growth, global oil demand is still forecast to be 3.2 million barrels per day higher in 2030 than in 2023 unless stronger policy measures are implemented or changes in behaviour take hold. - IEA OPEC is even more bullish, expecting oil demand growth to last beyond 2040, fueled by emerging market demand offsetting declines in OECD nations. OPEC Especially if we add that supply growth is slowing, we get a strong long-term thesis for oil and gas. In light of these developments, investors want a few things from an oil company: Deep reserves and growth potential. Healthy balance sheets. A focus on shareholders through (special) dividends and/or buybacks. BP has all of this. However, it also bet on non-oil operations. Last year, it had to admit it made a mistake when it promised to cut oil and gas output. At BP, Mr. Looney this week scaled back a high-profile goal he had championed in 2020 as a hallmark of his strategy. Instead of cutting oil-and-gas output this decade by 40% from 2019 levels, he said BP will now aim for a cut of around 25%. Mr. Looney emphasized BP’s intention to increase spending in both oil-and-gas production and renewables such as biogas, hydrogen and electric-vehicle charging networks. The world needs all of it, in parallel—but at the right speed, and that hasn’t been happening, Mr. Looney said. - The Wall Street Journal With all of this in mind, new headlines are now causing BP's underperformance to worsen. More Bad News The chart below shows the ratio between BP and the energy ETF ( XLE ). Including dividends, BP has consistently outperformed the XLE ETF since mid-2019. Last year, it briefly outperformed when it admitted betting on the end of oil was a mistake. Unfortunately, since then, it has almost nonstop underperformed XLE again. Data by YCharts Now, new headlines are popping up. This time less bullish. According to Bloomberg , the company is seeing headwinds from lower refining margins and writing down half of the initial value of its refinery in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Lower profits from making fuels such as diesel and higher levels of maintenance will have an adverse impact on BP’s second-quarter earnings from oil products of $500 million to $700 million, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Results from oil trading are expected to be weak, it said. - Bloomberg The company is scaling back refining operations in Germany as a result of high costs and lower demand. In general, Germany is struggling with elevated costs and a poor business climate. It also does not help that the Middle East and Asia are producing refined products much cheaper, allowing them to export to Europe. The good news is that the company expects upstream (oil and gas production) volumes to be flat in the second quarter. Initially, it expected these volumes to be down a bit. Nonetheless, headwinds are stronger than tailwinds, resulting in a year-to-date stock price performance of roughly -1%. That's down from a gain of more than 10% in April. Data by YCharts With that in mind, I am also not a fan of other headlines that involved the company, including the one below: Bloomberg Essentially, the British company is making the case the world isn't transitioning away from fossil fuels fast enough. Fossil fuel consumption broke records last year, led by climbing oil demand, the company said in its annual Energy Outlook on Wednesday. Countries remain in an “energy addition” phase — increasing their consumption of both low-carbon energy and fossil fuels — and need to pivot to a “substitution” phase, it said. If this trend continues to the early 2040s, the world may have exhausted the so-called “carbon budget” that would limit temperature increases to 2C above pre-industrial levels, BP cautioned. - Bloomberg Although the company knows the surge in renewable energy output is not enough to cover rising energy demand, it keeps making the case to shift away from oil much quicker, which is something I just don't get. I took a closer look at the full document , which included the outlook of less than 80 million barrels of oil demand by 2050, which would be a mile below OPEC's estimate of more than 106 million barrels of oil per day. BP The report even expects peak growth in (non-China) emerging markets in 2030. In the other emerging economies, increasing levels of prosperity and rising living standards support more resilient oil demand. In Current Trajectory, emerging economies’ demand increases until the mid-2030s after which it broadly plateaus. The increased electrification of road transport in Net Zero leads to more pronounced falls in oil consumption across emerging economies in the second half of the outlook. - BP According to OPEC, \"other non-OECD\" nations could see a demand increase of more than 10 million barrels per day through 2045. OPEC The good news is that while I absolutely disagree with the company's numbers and the fact that they even try to predict long-term demand, they continue to focus on upstream production. BP One of its goals is to improve its returns on employed capital to at least 18% next year. This includes boosting high-margin projects like oil, gas, and liquified natural gas. [...] we expect the start-up of a further five new major oil and gas projects. In addition, we expect bpx 2025 production to grow by 30-40% compared to 2022 levels. And in LNG, our target of 25 million tonnes per annum by 2025, up from 23 million tonnes per annum in 2023, is well underpinned. - BP BPX is the company's U.S. onshore business, where it produces in the Permian and Eagle Ford Basins. This includes production on Texas Pacific Land ( TPL ) ground. In May, TPL reported that BPX accounted for a large share of new and current wells. This makes sense, given the company's plans. Texas Pacific Land Corporation Efforts to boost upstream output are important, as the company isn't even close to being as profitable as its American peers. Both BP and Shell have a return on invested capital of 7%. Exxon and Chevron, who have both prioritized high-margin oil over renewables, have ROICs of 13% and 11%, respectively. Data by YCharts What does this mean for shareholders? Dividend & Valuation One bright spot is the company's dividend. It wants to pay a more consistent dividend, allowing investors to benefit from potential upside in energy prices. In the first quarter, it announced a 7.270 cents dividend (in British pound), which fits its strategy to keep a sustainable dividend in an environment of $40 Brent and $3 Henry Hub natural gas. Currently, BP yields 5.0%, which is higher than Exxon's 3.4% yield. With regard to its valuation, as I already briefly discussed, we are seeing a few interesting developments. The company trades at a blended P/E ratio of just 7.4x. Exxon has a blended P/E ratio of 12.1x. The normalized P/E ratio over the past two decades for BP is 10.9x. Exxon has a 14.5x normalized P/E ratio. Moreover, using the FactSet data in the chart below, analysts expect 12% EPS growth in both 2025 and 2026. FAST Graphs If the company moves back to a 10.9x multiple in this scenario, it could get a fair price target of $64, roughly twice its current price. The problem is that the market isn't willing to apply a higher multiple. There's just too much uncertainty in the oil and gas market and people seem to be unsure if European majors will change their outlook again. After all, if BP believes we are close to peak oil, it is unlikely it will boost its upstream output on a long-term basis. Even worse, in some areas, it may not even be up to BP, as the new government of the U.K. is looking to end North Sea drilling licenses and hike taxes on oil and gas companies. North Sea oil and gas producers urged Britain's incoming Prime Minister Keir Starmer to provide clarity on his election promise to increase tax on the sector, warning it could lead to a rapid decline in output and revenue. Starmer's Labour Party swept to power in a parliamentary election on Thursday, ending 14 years of Conservative government. The party's manifesto promised to rapidly build up Britain's renewable power, partly by increasing taxes on its oil and gas sector. It also vowed to end issuing new licences in the North Sea basin. - Reuters All things considered, BP may be yielding 5%, but that's where the good news ends. While it's not a bad business, it just isn't good enough to compete for shareholder capital. Especially not given the stronger business models of its American peers. As such, I will stick to a Hold rating, as I cannot make the case that BP can outperform the energy sector on a prolonged basis. Takeaway BP continues to struggle with its strategy and market positioning. Despite having solid reserves, a healthy balance sheet, and a high dividend yield, its focus on non-oil operations due to ESG pressures does not align with investor expectations. I believe the company's underperformance compared to American oil giants like Exxon and Chevron highlights the market's preference for traditional oil and gas investments over renewable ventures. Furthermore, with headwinds from refining margins and geopolitical challenges, BP's outlook remains challenging. Although its valuation is attractive, the uncertainty surrounding its long-term strategy keeps me cautious. It's also the reason why I stick to a Hold rating for the time being and continue to invest in U.S. and Canadian oil companies.

    "text": "Loading... Loading... Investors can contact the law firm at no cost to learn more about recovering their losses LOS ANGELES, July 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (\"Lamb Weston\" or the \"Company\") LW investors that a class action has been filed on behalf of investors. Lamb Weston investors that lost money on their investment are encouraged to contact Lesley Portnoy, Esq. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy , by phone 310-692-8883 or email : lesley@portnoylaw.com , to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case via www.portnoylaw.com . The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors' options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. On April 4, 2024, Lamb Weston reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter 2024 and disclosed significant problems with its transition to its new Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") software system, which had been designed to interface with the most important aspects of Lamb Weston's business and operations, including, among other things, inventories and customer order shipments. The system did not function properly, causing the Company to lose over $130 million in sales during its third quarter of fiscal 2024 and reduce its sales guidance for the full fiscal year by $330 million, at the midpoint. The unsuccessful ERP transition resulted in \"reduced visibility into finished goods inventories at distribution centers,\" which negatively impacted the Company's ability to fulfill customer orders, resulting in shipment delays and cancelled orders. In total, the ERP transition negatively impacted Lamb Weston's net sales by $135 million, net income by $72 million, and adjusted EBITDA by $95 million, with more than half of that due to lower sales and unfulfilled customer orders and the remainder due to incremental costs and expenses directly related to the ERP transition. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company also reported a 17% decline in sales volumes in North America year-over-year, more than half of which Lamb Weston attributed to the ERP transition. Lamb Weston also reduced its financial outlook for fiscal 2024, including a $330 million reduction to its sales guidance, at the midpoint. Lamb Weston disclosed that it expected its sales volumes in the fourth quarter to be negatively impacted by some customers in North America that were affected by the botched ERP transition, as those customers sought supply from Lamb Weston's competitors. On this news, Lamb Weston's stock price fell $19.59 per share, or 19.4%, to close at $81.53 per share on April 4, 2024.

    "text": "SEOUL, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) — South Korea’s corporate labor cost growth slowed last year due to bonus cutback, labor ministry data showed Monday. The per-capita monthly average labor cost in businesses with more than 10 regular employees increased 1.9 percent over the year to 6,131,000 won (4,700 U.S. dollars) in 2023, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. It was slower than an expansion of 8.2 percent in 2021 and 2.8 percent in 2022. Direct labor cost, including wage, overtime pay and bonus, gained 2.7 percent to 4,893,000 won (3,750 dollars) last year, lower than an expansion of 8.0 percent in 2021 and 3.0 percent in 2022. Sluggish corporate earnings led to the reduction in bonus among local companies struggling with economic slump. Indirect labor cost, such as retirement benefits, training expenses and welfare costs, shrank 1.1 percent from a year earlier to 1,238,000 won (950 dollars) in 2023 after growing 2.3 percent in the previous year. Labor cost in the finance and insurance industry declined 6.3 percent last year, but those in the manufacturing and the construction sectors climbed 1.7 percent and 5.8 percent each. The labor cost in businesses with less than 300 employees advanced 5.3 percent, but the labor expense in businesses with more than 300 workers retreated 1.0 percent last year.",

    "title": "Coeur Announces Achievement of Key Milestones at Expanded Rochester Mine",
    "text": "Mining and placement rates remain on-track Confirming full-year silver and gold production ranges Average crushing size trending toward year-end target Coeur Mining, Inc. (\"Coeur\" or the \"Company\") CDE today provided an operational update at the expanded Rochester silver-gold mine in Nevada, including positive throughput trends and significant progress on reducing overall crushing size. The new three-stage crushing circuit continues to deliver greatly enhanced levels of flexibility to accommodate the full range of mined ore at Rochester. For the month of August, approximately 2.7 million tons were placed on the new Stage VI leach pad, representing a 39% increase over July placement levels. Rochester remains on-track to place 7.0 – 8.0 million tons per quarter during the second half of 2024 and to achieve its full-year 2024 production guidance of 4.8 – 6.6 million ounces of silver and 37,000 – 50,000 ounces of gold. With the three-stage crusher fully ramped-up, the focus during the second half of the year has shifted to particle sizing optimization efforts, which are already exceeding expectations. The Company aims to end 2024 with reaching design particle size distribution (PSD) of approximately 80% passing 5/8 inch. Recent particle size distribution is reaching an average PSD of approximately 80% passing 3/4 inch, giving the Company confidence of achieving the year-end target. \"In just six months since first processing ore through the newly-expanded operation, the Rochester team continues to meet or exceed expectations across a number of key performance metrics, which is expected to be a key catalyst for generating Companywide positive free cash flow during the second half of the year,\" said Mitchell J. Krebs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"With crushing and placement rates consistently achieving nameplate capacity, the focus over the remainder of 2024 is on continuing to reduce the material crush size to achieve optimum recovery rates as we head into 2025. Additionally, recent exploration success within the current mining footprint continues to provide higher-grade upside potential to the current mine plan and positions Rochester for sustained success over a long expected mine life.\" About Coeur Coeur Mining, Inc. is a U.S.-based, well-diversified, growing precious metals producer with four wholly-owned operations: the Palmarejo gold-silver complex in Mexico, the Rochester silver-gold mine in Nevada, the Kensington gold mine in Alaska and the Wharf gold mine in South Dakota.

    "title": "Boeing In Spotlight After Fatal 737-800 Crash In South Korea, Stock Declined 28% Amid Deepening 2024 Challenges",
    "text": "Boeing Co. BA is back in the spotlight after a Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korea’s JejuAir crashed at Muan International Airport on Sunday, tragically killing 179 of 181 passengers and raising fresh questions about the aerospace manufacturer's safety record. What Happened : The crash comes amid Boeing’s ongoing challenges, including a 30% stock decline in 2024 and production restrictions imposed by federal regulators following January’s Alaska Airlines door plug incident on a 737 MAX aircraft, reported Associated Press on Sunday. JejuAir’s shares plunged 7.67% to 7,570 ($5.14) South Korean won following the crash, while Boeing’s stock, already down 28.22% year-to-date, faces uncertain trading as markets process the incident’s implications. Aviation consultant and former Delta Air Lines chief pilot Alan Price emphasized that the 737-800 involved in Sunday’s crash differs from the troubled MAX variant, calling it “a very proven airplane” with a strong safety record. “We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing wrote on X on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/TIrIUBw4RB See Also: Veteran Investor Bets Big On S&P 500 Hitting 7,000 By End Of 2025: These Sectors Could Lead The Charge Why It Matters : The incident adds to Boeing’s recent setbacks, including a seven-week machinists strike that disrupted production of key aircraft models and January’s FAA manufacturing oversight restrictions. The company has struggled to rebuild its reputation following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to $23 billion in losses. Under new leadership since CEO David Calhoun ‘s departure in August, Boeing has initiated safety improvement discussions among 70,000 employees. The cause of Sunday’s crash remains under investigation by South Korean authorities. Market analysts note that while distinct from previous 737 MAX issues, the crash could further impact investor confidence in Boeing as it competes with European rival Airbus for market share in the commercial aviation sector. Price Action : Boeing Co.’s stock is trading down 4.15% at $173.50 during Robinhood’s overnight trading service. On Friday, the stock closed at $180.72, up 0.19% for the day, before edging higher by 0.10% in after-hours trading to $180.90. Year to date, Boeing’s stock has fallen significantly, down 28.22%, according to data from Benzinga Pro . Boeing has a consensus price target of $197.85 from 23 analysts, with a high of $260 and a low of $85. The latest ratings from JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and RBC Capital average $158.33, implying a 12.47% downside. Boeing’s 30-day average trading volume stands at 10.71 million shares, with a 52-week range of $137.03 to $264.66. The company has a market capitalization of $135.34 billion, and its 14-day Relative Strength Index is at 77.4, indicating overbought conditions.

    "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Dutch Bros Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
    "text": "In the battle of coffee shop stocks, Dutch Bros ( BROS 1.09% ) looks like it will be the clear winner in 2024, as the company has greatly outperformed its larger rival Starbucks ( SBUX 0.94% ) this year. The stock is up more than 70% in 2024 versus about a 6.7% gain for Starbucks. Even with its strong performance, however, there are several reasons why Dutch Bros stock should keep growing and become a long-term winner. Let's look at three reasons investors should consider buying the stock hand over fist. 1. Dutch Bros is introducing additional food products While Dutch Bros stores are much smaller than Starbucks stores and rely primarily on drive-thru traffic, they surprisingly generate more revenue per store on average than Starbucks. Last quarter, Dutch Bros' average unit volume (AUV) was $2 million, well ahead of the approximately $1.5 million in AUV for Starbucks' U.S. locations. This likely can be attributed to the fact that Starbucks has a much larger and denser footprint. With fewer stores in an area, individual Dutch Bros stores will draw customers from a wider area. While Dutch Bros is beginning to add more locations within already existing markets, which can impact same-store sales by drawing traffic away from old stores to new stores, it still does have opportunities to increase same-store sales. One of the biggest opportunities to help on this front is with food. Last quarter, the company started testing more food offerings in six locations. Food currently represents only 2% of its sales, so this is a big opportunity if it can get it right. By contrast, in 2023, approximately 22% of Starbucks' sales came from food. 2. Dutch Bros is expanding mobile ordering In addition to food, another big opportunity to help drive sale-store sales for Dutch Bros is with mobile ordering. While mobile ordering has been a driver for many quick-service restaurant stocks over the past several years, Dutch Bros just recently began introducing it. It was available in 90% of its stores at the end of September, including in 96% of its company-owned locations. Nonetheless, mobile is still a small percentage of its orders at the moment due to the recent introduction of the offering. In Q3, it made up just 7% of its total orders. The company, however, was already beginning to see a sales lift, reporting that customers who have started using mobile ordering increased their frequency by about 5%. The company also said that it has begun to see an uptick in loyalty members as well, helped by its introduction of mobile orderings. Loyalty programs have been another big driver in the quick-service restaurant space, so this is another nice positive for the company that is still in its early days. 3. Plenty of expansion opportunities for Dutch Bros The biggest opportunity for Dutch Bros going forward, though, is expansion. The company ended last quarter with 950 stores, of which 645 were company-owned. That pales in comparison to the nearly 17,000 stores that Starbucks has in the U.S. alone. After a quick pause to reevaluate its real estate strategy moving forward, Dutch Bros plans to open 150 new locations this year, which was at the low end of its original guidance for the year. However, it will accelerate new store openings in 2025 to at least 160 stores and plans to open an even greater number in 2026. Overall, the company thinks it can increase its store base to more than 4,000 locations over the next 10 to 15 years. A more than four times increase in its number of stores over this period will undoubtedly drive a lot of growth. Just as importantly, though, Dutch Bros stores have a small footprint, with newer stores typically between 800 square feet and 1,000 square feet, with multiple drive-thru lanes served by one window and a walk-up window. This makes building out new stores relatively inexpensive. This allows Dutch Bros to fund its new store openings with its current operating cash flow. Through the first nine months of this year, Dutch Bros has generated $184.2 million in operating cash flow while spending $179 million on capital expenditures , most of which is going toward opening new stores. The company is expanding at a nice pace, but also within its means. Expansion stories typically run into trouble when companies take on debt and try to grow their store bases beyond their means, which is something Dutch Bros is not doing. A good time to buy Dutch Bros stock Despite its strong performance this year, Dutch Bros is still a solid option for investors to consider adding to their portfolios. While it trades at a higher valuation than Starbucks on a forward price-to-sales basis, it has a much larger growth opportunity ahead of it. BROS PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts As such, I think Dutch Bros remains a solid long-term option for investors as it continues to expand its store base over the next decade.",

    "text": "Berry Global Group, Inc. BERY shares are trading lower on Tuesday. On Monday, the company disclosed an agreement to sell its Specialty Tapes business to Nautic Partners, LLC, for around $540 million, subject to closing adjustments .

Ltd. InsightAce Analytic Pvt. Ltd. announces the release of a market assessment report on the \"Global Biofuel Market- (By Fuel Type (Ethanol, Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel, and Biojets), Generation (First Generation, Second Generation, Third Generation), End-use (Transportation, Aviation)), Trends, Industry Competition Analysis, Revenue and Forecast To 2031.\" According to the latest research by InsightAce Analytic, the Global Biofuel Market is valued at US$ 155.52 Bn in 2022, and it is expected to reach US$ 257.19 Bn by 2031, with a CAGR of 5.85% during a forecast period of 2024-2031. Request for free Sample Pages: https://www.insightaceanalytic.com/request-sample/2165 Biofuels, including ethanol from corn or sugarcane, woodchips, charcoal, and biogas from garbage breakdown, offer a versatile alternative fuel source. They are adaptable for use in vehicles, trucks, ships, and even aircraft. Currently, ethanol and biodiesel reign as the most widely used liquid biofuels. The global biofuel market is poised for significant growth. Driven by factors like rising oil prices, energy security concerns, and a desire to support farmers, many nations are implementing substantial incentives for biofuel production and use. Additionally, advancements in technology are leading to the development of new and improved biofuels. The expansion of biofuels and advanced powertrains creates a wider range of transportation fuel options. This benefits the environment and energy security by providing safe, clean, and sustainable alternatives to petroleum. Biofuels, particularly those derived from cellulosic crops and agricultural waste through cutting-edge biomass technologies, have the potential to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, biofuels offer hope for countries reliant on the liquid fuel industry. By diversifying fuel sources, these nations can lessen their dependence on external factors and price shocks. List of Prominent Players in the Biofuel Market: •ADM (US), •Chevron (US), •Valero (US), •Neste (Finland), •Cargill, Incorporated (US), •Wilmar International Ltd (Singapore), •VERBIO AG (Germany), •Borregaard AS (Norway), •POET, LLC (US), •The Andersons, Inc. (US), •Green Plains Inc. (US), •BP p.l.c. (UK), •FutureFuel Corporation (US), •Münzer Bioindustrie GmbH (Austria), •Aemetis, Inc. (US), •CropEnergies AG (Germany), •Raízen (Brazil), •Blue Biofuels, Inc. (US), •Pannonia Bio Zrt. (Hungary), •GreenJoules (India), •Algenol (US) Market Dynamics: Drivers- The growing demand for biofuel is fueled by using biofuels in vehicles, which will considerably aid in lowering CO2 emissions. By switching to an alternative energy source, fossil fuel emissions are prevented, and the resulting CO2 can be kept underground. As a result of the plants and trees that help serve as feedstocks for biofuels requiring CO2 for growth, more reductions occur. Therefore, the requirement to utilize eco-friendly gasoline will boost the liquid biofuels business in the future. Challenges: The prime challenge is high cost, a shortage of competent individuals and a lack of norms and protocol because consistent feedstock quality is essential for maximizing productivity and minimizing downtime. One difficulty facing the biofuels industry is the high and unpredictable price of feedstock. Different types of feedstock, facility locations, and market conditions can all affect the price of feed. This can make it tough for biofuels to compete with the more reliable pricing of fossil fuels. There has been widespread market disruption due to the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result of a scarcity of materials and labour, businesses in the biofuel industry confront several difficulties. Supply chain interruptions, lower demand for transportation fuels, and falling oil prices are some of the reasons that have impacted the market. Because of the transportation industry's dependence on bioethanol, that market has been struck very hard. Bioethanol's popularity as a gasoline additive has plummeted as a result of the global clampdown on freedom of movement and increased security measures. A number of ethanol factories have been forced to close or cut output, resulting in cheaper ethanol. Regional Trends: The North American biofuel market is anticipated to register a major market share in revenue. It is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future because there is a lot of material available to turn into biofuel. The region will dominate the global biofuels market because it has the necessary infrastructure for biofuel production and advantageous government regulations for the use of biofuels. Besides, Europe had a substantial market share because of the growing importance of energy infrastructure and increased factory investment. Investment in transmission infrastructure, government programs to cut carbon emissions, and expanding demand for renewable energy sources all contribute to this trend.
