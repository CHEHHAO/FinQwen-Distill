Dr. Kilcoyne joins us at a pivotal time for the Company, bringing extensive experience in drug development as we are progressing in our clinical programs. We expect to present Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025 for UCART22 in ALL and UCART20x22 for NHL\" said André Choulika, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. \"Additionally, we are excited to announce that research and development activities have started for three programs under our collaboration and research agreement with AstraZeneca: one allogeneic CAR T for hematological malignancies, one allogeneic CAR T for solid tumors, and one in vivo gene therapy for a genetic disorder. Cellectis is confident about the continued progress of its ongoing clinical trials in hematological malignancies and is excited about our strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, with whom we continue to advance our ambition in cell and gene therapy to bring potentially lifesaving therapies to patients with unmet medical needs.\" ________________________ 1 Cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets. Restricted cash was $5 million as of September 30, 2024. Fixed-term deposits classified as current financial assets were $100 million as of September 30, 2024. Pipeline Highlights UCART Clinical Programs Cellectis continues to focus on the enrollment of patients in the BALLI-01 study, evaluating UCART22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We expect to present the Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025. Cellectis continues to focus on the enrollment of patients in the NATHALI-01 study, evaluating UCART20x22 in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We expect to present the Phase 1 dataset and late-stage development strategy in 2025. The Company decided to focus its current development efforts on the BALLI-01 and NATHALI-01 studies and therefore to deprioritize the development of UCART123, currently evaluated in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Up to now, this study has provided important insights into the role of CD123-targeted allogeneic CAR-T therapy in relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia and the future development of our allogeneic CAR-T platform. MUC1 CAR T-cells for treating Triple-Negative Breast Cancer On September 3, 2024, Cellectis published a scientific article in Science Advances suggesting that TALEN®-edited MUC1 CAR T-cells could be a potential treatment option for advance-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with limited therapeutic options. In this article, Cellectis described its CAR T-cell engineering strategy using TALEN® and synthetic biology to multi-armor CAR T-cells with synergistic functionalities to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Partnerships Servier and Allogene – Allogeneic CAR-T Allogene's investigational oncology products utilize Cellectis technologies. Allogene announced that the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA3 trial was initiated in June 2024. This study is evaluating the use of cemacabtagene ansegedleucel (cema-cel) as part of the first line (1L) treatment regimen for patients with LBCL who are likely to relapse after standard 1L treatment. Allogene announced that ALPHA3 is the first pivotal trial to offer CAR T as part of 1L treatment consolidation. Allogene announced that enrollment is ongoing in the relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL cohort of the Phase 1 ALPHA2 trial of cema-cel, and that initial data readout from the CLL cohort is projected by early 2025. Allogene announced that a Phase 1 data update of the TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316 from approximately 20 patients with CD70 positive RCC is planned by YE 2024. In October 2024, Allogene announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-316 for the treatment of adult patients with CD70 positive advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). AstraZeneca – Joint Research and Collaboration Agreement Under the terms of the joint research and collaboration agreement entered into by Cellectis and AstraZeneca Ireland Limited (\"AstraZeneca\") on November 1, 2023 (the \"AZ JRCA\"), AstraZeneca is leveraging Cellectis' proprietary gene editing technologies and manufacturing capabilities to design novel cell and gene therapy candidate products. As part of the AZ JRCA, 25 genetic targets have been exclusively reserved for AstraZeneca, from which up to 10 candidate products could be explored for development. AstraZeneca has an option for a worldwide exclusive license on the candidate products, to be exercised before IND filing. Research and development activities under three cell and gene therapy programs have already started under the AZ JRCA: one allogeneic CAR T for hematological malignancies, one allogeneic CAR T for solid tumors, and one i n vivo gene therapy for a genetic disorder. Under the AZ JRCA, $47m have been triggered so far (of which $25m upfront and $22m reached development milestones for the three initial projects), in addition to reimbursement of research costs incurred under the AZ JRCA. Appointment On August 7, 2024, Cellectis announced the appointment of Adrian Kilcoyne, M.D., MPH, MBA as its Chief Medical Officer. Before joining Cellectis, Dr. Kilcoyne was Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research and Development at Celularity, advancing their oncology allogeneic CAR-T and NK Cell therapy programs. Prior to this, he was Chief Medical Officer at Humanigen. He has held numerous Oncology leadership roles across Research and Development, Medical Affairs, Commercial, Health Economic Outcome Research and Evidence Generation in both large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as AstraZeneca and Celgene. Dr. Kilcoyne graduated from Trinity College, Dublin Medical School. He initially trained in Gynecological Oncology at the Hammersmith Hospital in London and subsequently in Public Health Medicine at Oxford during which time he completed a Master's in Public Health. Dr. Kilcoyne then trained in pharmaceutical medicine and completed his MBA. Financial Results The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS\"). As from June 1, 2023, and the deconsolidation of Cibus, Inc. (formerly Calyxt, Inc.) (\"Cibus\") which corresponded to the Plants operating segment, we view our operations and manage our business in a single operating and reportable segment corresponding to the Therapeutics segment. For this reason, we are no longer presenting financial measures broken down between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants. In the appendices of this Q3 2024 financial results press release, Cibus' results are isolated under \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2023, and are no longer included for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to the deconsolidation. Cash: As of September 30, 2024, Cellectis had $264 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets. This compares to $156 million in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets as of December 31, 2023. This $108 million increase is mainly due to $140 million cash received from AstraZeneca as part of its equity investment in Cellectis, $16 million cash received from European Investment Bank (\"EIB\") pursuant to the disbursement of the €15 million Tranche B under the Finance Contract with EIB, $8 million of cash-in from our financial investments, $27 million of cash-in from our revenue, partially offset by cash payments from Cellectis to suppliers of $42 million, including $30 million to R&D suppliers and $12 million to SG&A suppliers, Cellectis' wages, bonuses and social expenses paid of $32 million, the payments of lease debts of $8 million and the repayment of the \"PGE\" loan of $4 million. With cash and cash equivalents of $159 million and $100 million term deposit classified as current financial assets as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes its cash and cash equivalents and deposits will be sufficient to fund its operations into 2027. Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $34.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This $26.8 million increase between the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 was mainly attributable to (i) recognition of a $28.3 million revenue in 2024 based (a) on the progress of our performance obligation rendered under the three programs under the AZ JRCA and (b) the reaching of a development milestone under the License, Development and Commercialization Agreement dated March 6, 2019 between Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier (together \"Servier\") and Cellectis as amended (the \"Servier License Agreement\"), and (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in other income. R&D Expenses : Consolidated R&D expenses were $69.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $62.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. R&D personnel expenses increased by $2.1 million from $25.7 million in 2023 to $27.8 million in 2024 mainly due to a reversal in September 2023 in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. R&D purchases, external expenses and other increased by $4.9 million (from $37.0 million in 2023 to $41.9 million in 2024) mainly related to increase in manufacturing activities to support our R&D pipeline. SG&A Expenses : Consolidated SG&A expenses were $14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. SG&A personnel expenses increased by $0.5 million (from $5 million in 2023 to $5.6 million in 2024). SG&A purchases, external expenses and other increased by $1.5 million (from $7.1 million in 2023 to $8.6 million in 2024). Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income and expenses were a $0.9 million net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a $0.1 million net expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other operating income increased by $1 million primarily due to the recognition of revenues from American Depository Shares (\"ADS\") movements of $0.5 million and $0.3 million related to the subleased portion of our premises in New-York. Net financial gain (loss): We had a consolidated net financial gain of $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a $7 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This $12.6 million difference reflects mainly (i) a $14.3 million gain in change in fair value of SIA derivative instrument, (ii) a $5.6 million increase in gain from our financial investments, (iii) a $2.6 million gain in change in fair value of EIB Tranche A and Tranche B, (iv) the loss in fair value measurement on Cytovia convertible note recognized in the nine months period ended September 30, 2023 of $7.9 million, partially offset by (i) an increase of $1.8 million in interest expense on Tranche A and Tranche B of the EIB Finance Contractand (ii) a $5.3 million increase in foreign exchange loss, (iii) a decrease in net foreign exchange gain of $8.6 million and (iv) a $1.5 million increase of the loss in fair value of our investment in Cibus. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations : Net income from discontinued operations of $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 corresponded to Calyxt's results. Since Cibus has been deconsolidated since June 1, 2023, there is no longer any \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations\" for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis : Consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $42.7 million (or a $0.49 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a $59.3 million loss (or a $1.09 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $75 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. The $24 million change in net loss was primarily driven by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $26.8 million, (ii) a $12.6 million change from a net financial loss of $7 million to a net financial gain of $5.7 million and (iii) a decrease in net other operating expense of $1 million, and (iv) a $8.4 million decrease in net income from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, partially offset by (i) an increase of $6.4 million in purchases, external expenses and other, and a (ii) an increase of $0.8 million in wages and (iii) an increase of $1.7 million in non-cash stock based compensation expense. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis : Consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $40.4 million (or a $0.46 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million (or a $1.05 loss per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Please see \"Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis. We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2024 in the following areas: supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates, including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART22, UCART20x22 and potential new product candidates, and operating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France), and Raleigh (North Carolina, USA).

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense, we believe that this financial measure, when considered together with our IFRS financial statements, can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis' financial performance. Moreover, our management views the Company's operations, and manages its business, based, in part, on this financial measure. In particular, we believe that the elimination of non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS.

The market growth is driven by the rising global energy demand, owing to population expansion, industrialization, and urban development. Additionally, the rising concern of depleting conventional oil reserves is increasing reliance on EOR techniques to optimize production. Furthermore, technological advancements, stringent environmental regulations, and the demand for sustainable energy solutions are promoting the adoption of technologies that mitigate the environmental impact of oil extraction, driving market demand. The changing geopolitical landscape and fluctuations in oil prices are the macroeconomic factors contributing to market growth. Thus, the governments are actively focusing on enhanced oil recovery.

    "prompt": "Title: \"Here’s all the income tax changes from today’s Budget\"\nText: \"Finance Minister Jack Chambers and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe A range of tax changes and one-off measures announced in the Budget should leave most people better off. Finance Minister Jack Chambers said the changes to personal income taxes would support low and middle-income earners. The personal income tax package announced is worth €1.6b. The Government is increasing the main tax credits – the personal, employee and earned income credits – by €125 each. A tax credit is amount you offset against the tax you pay, or an amount you can earn before paying tax. This means the maximum employee tax credit for 2025 will be €2,000 for a single person. If you are married or in a civil partnership and both of you have PAYE income, you are both entitled to claim the employee tax credit. There is also a €2,000 increase in what is called the standard rate cut-off point. This means workers will be able to earn more before paying the top tax rate of 40pc. This is because what’s the standard rate cut-off point goes from €42,000 to €44,000. The Budget announcement saw an €150 increase in the home carer tax credit, an €150 increase in the single child carer credit, a €300 rise in the incapacitated child tax credit and a €300 increase in the blind person credit. And Mr Chambers reduced the Universal Social Charge (USC) middle rate from 4pc to 3pc. This applies to income between €25,000 and €70,000. The entry threshold to the new 3pc USC rate is being increased by €1,622 to €27,382, in line with the increase to the national minimum wage. This means that a full time worker on the minimum wage will see an increase in their net take home pay of approximately €1,424 on an annual basis. A single person earning €20,000 or less in 2025 will now be outside of the income tax net. The energy credits are being reduced to €250, a fraction of last year's giveaway of €450. Rent tax credit is increasing by €250, bringing it to €1,000 and €2,000 for a jointly assessed couple for 2025. Minister Chamber said that the credit for 2024 is being increased to €1,000 and €2,000 for a jointly assessed couple.

If the first Trump administration is a guide, inflation is likely to be low. \"Take the tape, rewind it, put it back to 2019 and let's go from there,\" Zervos said. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by another quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting next week. > 24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are \"Two years ago ... 3 out of 4 economists were saying we're going into a recession,\" David Zervos, chief market strategist for Jefferies LLC, said during CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit on Tuesday. \"They've really had it wrong.\" The economy is still growing and inflation has come down, he said. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation stood at 2.3% in October, or 2.8% when excluding food and energy prices, according to the latest reading. Meanwhile, the fourth quarter is on track to post a 3.3% annualized growth rate for gross domestic product, the Atlanta Fed found. \"I think the market is spending way too much time focused on the inflationary consequences of either immigration or trade policies,\" Zervos said.

By most indicators, 2025 is going to continue in a positive direction, Barbara Doran, CEO of BD8 Capital Partners, said during the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit. \"Economic growth is going to be healthy next year,\" Doran said. \"The prognosis is good.\" Meanwhile, there is still the issue of President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy when he begins his second term. On one hand, \"we've got a lot of deregulation coming,\" Zervos said, which he called a \"huge disinflationary tailwind.\" \"Take the tape, rewind it, put it back to 2019 and let's go from there,\" Zervos said. In part because of such policies, during the last Trump administration \"we saw very little inflation,\" he said. \"We never really bounced out of that 2% range ... so I am really optimistic on the inflation side.\" However, questions remain on Trump's plans to issue punitive tariffs and whether that could stoke inflation once again. In November, Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, said in a note that the proposed tariffs would boost consumer prices by nearly 1% . \"It's still a big wildcard that we have to see,\" Doran said. \"It would be inflationary ultimately, but it would hurt the lowest income consumer, who is already hurting.\" If inflation does creep up as a result, that may delay more rate cuts after December's meeting, she added . Other experts also expect the Fed to slow down its pace of rate cuts in 2025.

    "prompt": "Title: \"Fortify Your Digital Treasure: The Safest Crypto Wallets of 2024!\"\nText: \"In an age where digital treasures are more precious than gold, crypto losses have skyrocketed to a staggering $2 billion this year, with hacking incidents spiking 21% compared to the last. These hair-raising figures underscore an urgent need for the most secure crypto wallets. Yet, the fortress needs more than just thick walls. Today’s ultimate wallet also equips its bearers with cutting-edge tools to outpace market shifts and swell their coffers. This includes the agility to hop across blockchains, sophisticated trading tools, and the golden opportunity to earn passive income. Look into our exploration of the four stalwarts guarding the crypto realm this year: Plus Wallet, Trust Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Ledger Wallet. Our deep dive into their arsenals will arm you with the knowledge to pick the shield that best guards your digital gold. 1. Plus Wallet: The Vault That Pays You Back Emerging as a titan in the crypto defense league, Plus Wallet offers an impenetrable safe haven with a suite of mighty features. It anchors private keys right on your device, granting you the sole key to your digital vault. This local safekeeping, fortified by unbreakable encryption, slashes the dangers lurking with third-party storage.

Plus Wallet is a gateway to asset management nirvana, with its ability to juggle multiple assets through its cross-chain prowess, simplifying your crypto conquests. Tokens debut on the platform in a mere 15 minutes, catapulting you to the forefront of new ventures. Moreover, every trade with Plus Wallet sprinkles golden coins into your coffer, rewarding your trading zeal with continuous passive income. This blend of supreme security and lucrative features crowns Plus Wallet the ultimate guardian for those seeking safety, ease, and a steady stream of earnings. 2. Trust Wallet: Your Portal to Digital Wonders Trust Wallet stands as a versatile champion, supporting an extensive array of cryptocurrencies and tokens across varied blockchains. It’s your magic carpet to the bustling bazaars of decentralized applications, from Uniswap to Compound, and to the vibrant alleys of NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. The wallet facilitates secure crypto exchanges with ease. However, it may fall short in the realm of customer support and educational riches—a potential chink in its armor for those seeking wisdom along their journey. Furthermore, its alliance with Binance, the centralized empire, might deter purists dreaming of complete decentralization. 3. Ledger Wallet: The Movable Fortress Closing our list with Ledger, the steadfast hardware wallet, including models like the Nano S Plus and Nano X, offers a robust yet flexible way to manage a diverse array of cryptocurrencies through the intuitive Ledger Live app. These compact warriors are ready to secure your assets on the go. The Nano X even boasts Bluetooth capabilities, allowing you to manage your fortunes wirelessly via mobile devices. While Ledger marries convenience with security, the cost of its armor and its closed-source nature have sparked debates about its transparency. 4. OKX Wallet: The Multi-Chain Knight OKX Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain maestro, is ready to guard your cryptos on both Mac OS and Windows. It supports heavyweights like Tron, enabling seamless crypto transactions. It employs Multi-Party Computation (MPC), cleverly dividing private keys into fragments to fortify your defenses, minimizing the threat of a single fatal blow. Despite its prowess, its limited fiat dealings might ruffle the feathers of those frequently converting between crypto and traditional realms. Key Insights Each wallet has proven its mettle as one of the most secure crypto guardians of 2024, yet each serves different needs. OKX Wallet is perfect for desktop warriors, though it may not satisfy those needing frequent fiat interactions. Ledger Wallet is ideal for those on the quest for sturdy, portable protection, offering devices at various costs. Trust Wallet and Plus Wallet shine for those who crave extensive blockchain freedom and asset management prowess. However, Trust Wallet may not fulfill the dreams of those who yearn for absolute decentralization. On the flip side, Plus Wallet excels as one of the safest crypto wallets for those chasing effortless passive riches, rewarding mere participation in the trading arena.

Announces Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2024 Results with Strategic Restructuring, Third-Party Debt Repayment, and Core Technology Focus\"\nText: \"NAPLES, Fla., Nov. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN – HealthLynked Corp. ( OTCQB: HLYK ), a leader in healthcare networking and technology innovation, today announced financial results for the three- and nine-months ending Sept. 30, 2024. With a renewed commitment to profitable growth, HealthLynked has restructured its clinical operations, reduced its third-party debt obligations, reduced physical plant cost and shifted focus toward its core software solutions, positioning the company for enhanced operational efficiency and scalability in the future. Financial Highlights Revenue: HealthLynked reported revenue of $0.59 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a 56% decrease year-over-year from $1.33 million in Q3 2023 and a 26% sequential decline from $0.80 million in Q2 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, revenue totaled $2.39 million, a 12% drop from the preceding nine-month period (October 2023 to June 2024) and a 50% decrease from $4.79 million in the first nine months of 2023. This decline is primarily due to expected clinical revenue disruption resulting from our restructuring efforts related to onboarding of new clinical staffing, consolidating clinical locations and other right-sizing efforts. Expense Reductions: HealthLynked reduced practice operating expenses by $0.50 million, or 39%, in Q3 2024 to $0.80 million, compared to $1.30 million in Q3 2023. Year-to-date, expenses decreased by 38%, underscoring the company's continued focus on efficiency. Overall, total operating expenses fell by 10% in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and by 19% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Loss from Operations: The loss from operations for Q3 2024 was increased by $0.49 million. From $1.18 million, to $1.67 million loss in Q3 2023. Year-to-date, the loss from operations was $3.93 million, representing a 29% increase over the $3.04 million loss in the same period of 2023. Net Income/Loss: HealthLynked reported a net loss of $1.97 million in Q3 2024, compared to a net loss of $0.17 million in Q3 2023. This difference was primarily attributable to a $1.08 million gain in 2023 related to the sale of ACO Health Partners. For the first nine months of 2024, the net loss was $4.90 million, contrasting with a net income of $0.27 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to $3.76 million gains related to the ACO Health Partners sale recorded in 2023. Strategic Outlook HealthLynked remains committed to expanding its footprint through strategic partnerships and a growing user base. The company is shifting its focus from traditional clinical operations to app-based services, aiming to increase both user acquisition and revenue through innovative digital solutions. By leveraging its patient-centric network, HealthLynked anticipates significant growth in its membership base, enhancing healthcare accessibility for patients and providers alike. HealthLynked's software platform's cost is significantly lower than the variable costs associated with operating clinical services. This shift allows HealthLynked to minimize the fluctuations in costs and revenue that typically accompany clinic operations, resulting in a leaner, more efficient business model. CEO Contribution and Financial Support Dr. Michael Dent, CEO of HealthLynked, has played a crucial role in providing the necessary financial support for the company's operations during this period of transition, with $2.7 million in debt funded so far in 2024. His commitment has enabled HealthLynked to navigate this restructuring phase successfully, setting a foundation for future growth as the company benefits from reduced third-party debt service and an optimized cost structure. Executive Commentary Dr. Michael Dent, CEO of HealthLynked, stated, \"Our restructuring efforts in our clinical operations are designed to maximize profitability and support our transition toward core technology solutions. With telemedicine services just now available in all 50 states and our paid concierge services gaining traction, HealthLynked is well-positioned to drive revenues by focusing on the value of our patient-centric software platform. This shift allows us to better serve patients and providers across the nation, reducing operational overhead while expanding our reach and impact in healthcare.\" About HealthLynked HealthLynked Corp. is dedicated to improving global community health.

Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty Images Affordable housing is a cornerstone of the \"opportunity economy\" that Vice President Kamala Harris sketched out last week. Harris' economic policy pitch included proposals to lower the costs of owning and renting a home in the U.S. \"We should be making everything to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less,\" Harris said during her speech in Raleigh, N.C. More from Personal Finance: Trump and Harris both want no taxes on tips Vance wants a $5,000 child tax credit — but that could be difficult Here’s what a Kamala Harris administration could mean for your wallet The Democratic presidential nominee called for the construction of 3 million new housing units, both for rent and for sale, over the next four years — an initiative housing experts say would help improve affordability. That's \"the most exciting part of her plans to me,\" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. Supply is housing policy's 'bipartisan sweet spot' \"The bipartisan sweet spot around the housing affordability challenges that we have today is on increasing supply,\" said Dennis Shea, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's J. Ronald Terwilliger Center for Housing Policy. Ever since the foreclosure crisis, a major period of property seizures in the U.S. between 2007 and 2010, there have been far fewer new single-family homes and multi-family rental buildings under construction, said Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a non-profit think tank in Washington, D.C. There's \"a more acute shortfall\" when it comes to affordable homes, she said, whether for renters looking for quality rental units or first-time buyers looking for their first home. watch now VIDEO 4:13 04:13 Housing prices rise despite more supply: Here's why Squawk Box To get to those 3 million new units, a Harris-Walz administration would introduce a \"first-ever tax incentive\" for home builders who build starter homes sold to first-time homebuyers, according to the proposals unveiled last week. The initiative would complement the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, according to the announcement. A bill pending in Congress called the Neighborhood Home Investment Act , which would promote the creation and rehab of starter homes for sale in distressed communities, would create that tax credit, said Shea. \"It would create this tax credit, and that has strong bipartisan support,\" he said. My conclusion is that [Harris'] housing plan would be worse than doing nothing. Edward Pinto senior fellow and codirector of the American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center Former President Donald Trump has also talked about ways to increase housing supply as part of his presidential campaign proposals. \"We're going to open up tracks of federal land for housing construction,\" Trump said in an Aug. 15 press conference. \"We desperately need housing for people who can't afford what's going on now.\" But Edward Pinto, senior fellow and codirector of the American Enterprise Institute's Housing Center, said it's \"much, much harder\" for the government to pass \"supply-side proposals,\" compared to efforts that generate demand by making homebuying easier for consumers. \"My conclusion is that [Harris'] housing plan would be worse than doing nothing,\" he said. 'It's hard to define what a starter home is' It will be important for Harris to clarify what she means by \"starter home,\" said James Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. \"It's hard to define what a starter home is,\" said Tobin, as underlying costs make it hard to keep building expenses low. \"In most markets in the country, it's hard to build to that first-time home buyer because of labor costs, land costs, borrowing costs for a builder, and then material cost,\" he said. watch now VIDEO 4:54 04:54 Harris economic plan will try to 'tell story' combating inflation criticism The Exchange Defining a range of price points for a starter home will also be important, as it may vary widely across different markets, said Tobin. \"In California, a starter home might cost seven or $800,000, but in the South ... it might only be $250,000 or $300,000,\" he said. The $40 billion innovation fund seems 'very high' The list of Harris' proposals also includes a $40 billion innovation fund. The money would empower local governments to fund local solutions to build housing, as well as support local solutions to build housing. Yet some experts are skeptical it will fulfill the intended goal. \"The federal government doesn't have a whole lot of authority over what happens at the local level,\" said Fairweather. \"It's up to the local planning commissions whether they're going to allow for more housing in order to get that [innovation fund] money.\" \"But time and time again, locals and local governments, local homeowners ignore incentives because they're so resistant to building more housing,\" said Fairweather. Additionally, the $40 billion housing innovation fund may be too high of a cost, making it unlikely to receive bipartisan support, said Shea: \"I don't know if the market could bear that price tag in Congress.\" Aid for first-time home buyers has less support Harris hopes to provide $25,000 down-payment assistance to first-time homebuyers who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for qualifying first-generation homeowners. The proposal stems from an idea the Biden-Harris administration presented earlier this year , which called on Congress to implement $25,000 in down-payment assistance exclusively for 400,000 first-generation buyers (or first-time buyers whose parents weren't homeowners) and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time buyers. Harris' blueprint would apply to all first-time buyers and broaden the reach to more than 4 million qualifying applicants over four years. But \"there's just not a lot of bipartisan support,\" said Shea. During an Aug. 16 appearance on Fox Business, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said Harris' $25,000 down payment assistance \"will only make the demand higher with the supply not moving, which means that prices will go up, fewer people are going to be able to afford it.\" \"And frankly, unless they're going to embed financial literacy in any program, it only means there will be a higher level of default,\" said Scott. To help renters, Harris addressed two pending pieces of legislation. The Democratic presidential nominee called on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act , a bill that calls for removing key tax benefits for those who own 50 or more single family properties. This initiative would curtail major investors from buying up large sums of single-family rental homes. Meanwhile, the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act would crack down on companies who use tools to fix market rent prices.\"",

    "prompt": "Title: \"Cansortium Inc. Completes New Senior Secured Credit Agreement Ahead of Planned Business Combination Closing with RIV Capital\"\nText: \"TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cansortium Inc. (CSE: TIUM.U) (OTCQB: CNTMF) (“Cansortium” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated, multi-state cannabis company operating under the FLUENTTM brand, announced today that it has closed on a new senior secured credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) of up to $96,500,000 with Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC (“Chicago Atlantic”), as administrative agent for certain lenders. The Credit Agreement bears a cash interest rate of 12.00% per annum and paid-in-kind (PIK) interest of 1.00% per annum, and is due to mature on November 26, 2028. The Credit Agreement refinances the existing $71,000,000 senior secured term loan that was set to mature May 29, 2025, thereby eliminating the previously disclosed requirement that the Company prepay $10,000,000 upon the consummation of the business combination with RIV Capital Inc. (CSE: RIV) (OTC: CNPOF) (“RIV Capital”), a vertically integrated cannabis company operating the Etain brand in New York. All required regulatory approvals needed for the business combination with RIV Capital Inc. have been obtained and the Company expects the closing with RIV Capital to occur in early December 2024. “We are excited to announce the successful completion of our senior secured refinancing. The loan’s favorable interest rate and single financial covenant underscore our strong financial standing, while its non-dilutive structure - free of equity or warrants – preserves shareholder value. As a result of this transaction, we have no material debt maturities until late 2028,” said Robert Beasley, CEO of Cansortium. “The refinancing includes access to two additional credit lines totaling $25 million, which, combined with the cash balance inflow from the RIV business combination, positions us to enter 2025 with a robust war chest. These resources will allow us to pursue strategic acquisitions and growth initiatives in key markets like Pennsylvania and New York, while also targeting new opportunities in emerging high-growth states. With our solid foundation and this enhanced financial flexibility, we are poised to capitalize on exciting industry developments at the state and federal levels. The future for our company – and our shareholders – has never been brighter.” The Credit Agreement provides for an initial loan of $71,500,000 and access to two additional credit lines of $10,000,000 for future real estate acquisitions and construction projects, and $15,000,000 in the event that the Company were to acquire RIV Capital’s Buffalo cultivation and processing facility following the completion of the business combination. “Cansortium has executed with prudence and foresight in its core states of Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas, and we have every confidence in their strategic approach to meet demands in additional markets,” said Peter Sack, Managing Parter of Chicago Atlantic. “They are innately focused on customer experience, fiscal responsibility, and operational excellence, and Chicago Atlantic is thrilled to support their next phase of growth.” The Credit Agreement includes a single financial covenant requiring Cansortium to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $4,500,000, tested at the end of each fiscal quarter, and includes customary terms and conditions for a financing of this type, including repayment obligations upon the occurrence of certain events of default thereunder. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed on the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca . Chicago Atlantic Credit Advisers, LLC served as lead arranger for the Credit Agreement and Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC serves as Administrative Agent for the Credit Agreement. Smith Transaction Cansortium and certain of its affiliates and William Smith, a director and the Executive Chair of Cansortium, and certain companies controlled by Mr. Smith (together with Mr. Smith, collectively, the “Smith Group”), have entered into an amended and restated termination agreement (the “Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement”) to replace in its entirety the existing termination agreement dated May 30, 2024 (the “Smith Transaction Termination Agreement”), which provided for, among other things, the termination of that certain agreement among Cansortium, certain of its affiliates and the Smith Group (the “Initial Smith Transaction Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement, Cansortium paid to the Smith Group a $500,000 cash fee and issued to the Smith Group a 15% secured subordinated convertible note in an initial aggregate principal amount of $6,500,000 due May 26, 2029 (the “Smith Convertible Note”). The Smith Convertible Note is subordinated in right of payment to prior payment in full of the Credit Agreement and the principal and accrued interest thereunder is convertible, at the discretion of the Smith Group, into Cansortium Shares at a price of $0.21 per Cansortium Share. For more information on the Smith Transaction Termination Agreement and the Initial Smith Transaction Agreement, see Cansortium’s news release dated May 30, 2024 filed under Cansortium’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca . The transactions contemplated by the Amended Smith Transaction Termination Agreement (the “Smith Transaction”) constitutes a “related party transaction” as such term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Securityholders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). Cansortium has relied on the exemptions from obtaining a formal valuation and minority shareholder approval of the Cansortium Shareholders with respect to the Smith Transaction in accordance with sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the aggregate fair market value of the cash consideration and the Smith Convertible Note issuable in connection with the Smith Transaction does not exceed 25% of Cansortium’s market capitalization as determined in accordance with the provisions of MI 61-101. In addition, the Smith Transaction was approved by the Cansortium Board, with Mr. Smith having disclosed his interest in the Smith Transaction and abstaining from voting thereon. Cansortium did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the Smith Transaction as the details of the Smith Transaction had not been finalized at that time.

Book of Meme (BOME): Preserving Meme Culture on the Blockchain Book of Meme (BOME) is an experimental project that combines memes, decentralized storage, and degen trading in the web3 space. It aims to create a digital compendium, the Book of Meme, to capture and preserve meme culture on the blockchain. The $BOME memecoin operates on Solana, with Arweave and IPFS serving as primary storage solutions, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for immutable storage. This initiative seeks to establish a new form of decentralized social media, making memes unstoppable. The coin's integration of popular blockchain technologies and focus on meme culture may appeal to enthusiasts in the current market cycle. FET Primed for Growth Ahead of Upcoming Altcoin Season FET is trading between $1.55 and $2.06. In the past week, its price has fallen by over 30%, but signs point to a possible rise. The RSI is below 40, meaning it may be oversold. This suggests the price could start climbing soon. The current price is near the support level at $1.29, where buyers often enter the market. The Simple Moving Average over the past 100 days is around $1.53, close to the current price, which aligns with long-term trends. If the price bounces from support, it might break the resistance at $2.32. Passing this level could lead to $2.83, a gain of over 30%. With altcoin season coming, FET could grow significantly. Chill Guy: Embracing Calm in a Chaotic World Through a Laid-Back Meme Chill Guy is a new meme character known for his super relaxed and carefree attitude. He embodies a \"lowkey\" vibe—calm, casual, and unbothered by life's challenges. In illustrations, he appears laid-back, wearing a grey sweater, blue jeans, and red shoes, smirking with his hands in his pockets. This demeanor has resonated on platforms like TikTok, where users praise him as the best new meme character for his cool, \"whatever\" attitude. The Chill Guy movement seeks to spread the art of staying chill in a chaotic world, helping individuals discover mindfulness and inner peace. While there is enthusiasm around the character, any associated coin or technology is speculative, and its potential in the current market cycle remains uncertain. Uniswap's UNI Token: Governance and Potential in Decentralized Finance Uniswap is a decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain that uses an automated liquidity protocol. Its UNI token, launched in September 2020, lets holders vote on changes to the platform, like fee structures and token distribution. In response to competition from SushiSwap, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, giving 400 tokens to each, worth over $1,000 at launch. This move aimed to encourage loyalty. Uniswap's open-source nature and free token listing set it apart from centralized exchanges. As one of the largest DeFi platforms with over $3 billion in assets, the UNI token holds potential and may be attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion In the current bull run, while BOME, CATSLAP, CHILLGUY, and UNI may offer less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it aims to bring financial freedom to all. Catzilla invites everyone to join the fight against crypto villains.

    "prompt": "Title: \"Riskiest Real Estate Bonds Are Beating Nvidia’s Returns\"\nText: \"(Bloomberg) -- A previously gloomy corner of the debt world has become the biggest winning trade in global financial markets, producing returns that few traders have seen in more than a decade. Most Read from Bloomberg Hybrids, the riskiest slice of a real estate company’s debt, have returned more than 75% this year. For the top 10 performers for the securities also known as subordinated bonds, returns amount to about 170% in the period, beating Nvidia Corp.’s stock, the darling of the AI craze, by 20 percentage points. It’s the kind of swift turnaround that few could have predicted when landlords around the world were creaking under the weight of higher interest rates and changing work habits following the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, real estate debt is becoming an early winner from major central banks cutting borrowing costs amid a pivot to prioritizing the economy over battling inflation. “I cannot recall something similar in my career,” said Andrea Seminara, chief executive officer at London-based Redhedge Asset Management, who started working in finance at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. “The magnitude of the gains is unprecedented, unless we look at pure distressed situations.” Replacement Cost Landlords’ subordinated bonds had plunged nearly 50% after central banks began to increase rates in 2022. Higher borrowing costs meant the cost to replace them shot up, leaving investors fearful that repayment would be delayed indefinitely. Companies can also sometimes skip coupons on the notes without triggering a default, making them less popular with investors. “These bonds were punished due to technical factors,” said Andreas Meyer, founder of Hamburg-based Fountain Square Asset Management. “There was blood on the streets.” For Seminara, buying at those depressed levels was effectively a bet that companies would be able to replace debt that was coming due and that falling inflation would allow central banks to cut interest rates. Both proved correct. The companies faced a so-called maturity wall that collapsed in historic fashion this year as capital flowed into the credit market, allowing landlords to issue new debt to refinance old bonds. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve this month joined the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in cutting its policy rate and leaving open the possibility of further large cuts. Meyer’s event-driven fund is among those that reaped the benefits, gaining as much as 80% in its hybrid bonds. He still has exposure in the sector. The main risk now is that there is little juice left in the trade. Strategists Barnaby Martin and Ioannis Angelakis at Bank of America Corp. flagged in a report last week that “valuations are clearly nearer to becoming full” in real estate credit. Still, buyers and sellers are becoming more confident that the commercial real estate market is bottoming out. Many want to start putting capital to work as the interest rate pain starts to ease. “We have lived through a sh*tstorm. No one has lived through a monetary policy as aggressive as we have seen in the last two years,” Madison International Realty founder Ron Dickerman said in an interview. “A couple of rate cuts does not make a market, but there’s optimism.” Week in Review China disclosed a series of stimulus measures designed to boost flagging growth in the nation. It unveiled its biggest package yet to shore up its beleaguered property market, lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing down-payment requirements for second home purchases to a historical low. China is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy. While some details are missing, the unusual pace and intensity of the stimulus announcements signaled a sense of urgency in Beijing to put growth on track for the around 5% target, buoying market sentiment. Separately, the nation began marketing its first euro-denominated bond in three years. US companies and Asian issuers stormed debt markets following the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to lower its benchmark interest rate by half-a-percentage-point. A resurgence in mergers and acquisitions dealmaking is turbocharging the US high-grade bond market to its fastest pace of issuance since 2020, putting it on track to post $1.5 trillion of sales. Banks and other lenders are lining up more than €10 billion ($11.1 billion) of debt to back a buyout of Sanofi SA’s consumer health division, as one of the most hotly-anticipated sales of the year reaches its final stages. Blue Owl Capital Inc. led the $3.2 billion private debt financing supporting Blackstone Inc. and Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software firm Smartsheet Inc., with 20 other lenders participating. Citigroup Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are teaming up in the fast-growing private credit market, agreeing to work together on $25 billion worth of deals over the next five years. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s structured credit business Atlas SP Partners received its broker-dealer license and is preparing to start secondary trading. Country Garden Holdings Co. has won bondholders’ approval to push back payments on its nine yuan bonds by six months, giving the developer more time to map out an onshore debt overhaul. Credit Agricole SA is looking to raise capital with a bond that has to be repaid after only a decade, adding to a recent raft of longer-duration instruments as investors look to take advantage of the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts. Altice France has held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, a move that would potentially hurt existing creditors. A group of banks led by Bank of America Corp. sweetened terms on a leveraged loan offering to help finance Platinum Equity’s acquisition of GSM Outdoors as the deal struggled to attract demand from investors. Dish Network Corp. is close to striking a deal with some of its convertible bondholders that would give the company new financing and help it extend its debt maturities. Hooters of America is huddling with lenders and advisers amid revenue declines that pushed the restaurant chain to shutter several of its locations. On the Move Brian Sauvigne, a former Blackstone Inc. senior managing director, rejoined Bank of Montreal’s financial-sponsors group. RBC Capital Markets hired Sam Pfeiffer, previously with Morgan Stanley, as head of US investment grade systematic credit trading. M&G Investments recruited Joe Sullivan-Bissett to be an investment director in its £137 billion fixed income division, reporting to David Parsons, head of the fixed income specialist team. Alberta Investment Management Corp. appointed David Scudellari, the fund’s head of international investment, to oversee private assets and strategic partnerships, and Justin Lord as senior executive managing director for public markets. Meanwhile, Chief Investment Officer Marlene Puffer is departing. --With assistance from Eleanor Duncan and Dan Wilchins. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\"",

(\" Mountain Province \", the \"Company\") (TSX: MPVD) (OTC: MPVD) today announces production and sales results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (\"the Quarter\" or \"Q3 2024\") from the Gahcho Kué Diamond Mine (\"GK Mine\"). All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Q3 2024 Production Takeaways ( all figures are reported on a 100% basis unless otherwise stated ) 1,187,912 carats recovered, 10% less than Quarter 3 2023 (Q3 2023: 1,326,160 carats) Average grade of 1.24 carats per tonne, 18% less than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 1.51 carats per tonne) 923,814 ore tonnes mined, 4% more than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 887,695 ore tonnes mined) 961,371 ore tonnes treated, 10% more than Q3 2023 (Q3 2023: 877,617 tonnes treated) Q3 2024 Production Figures 2024 Q3 2023 Q3 YoY Variance Total tonnes mined (ore and waste) 8,603,369 9,145,849 -6 % Ore tonnes mined 923,814 887,695 4 % Ore tonnes treated 961,371 877,617 10 % Carats recovered 1,187,912 1,326,160 -10 % Carats recovered (49% share) 582,077 649,818 -10 % Recovered grade (carats per tonne) 1.24 1.51 -18 % Q3 2024 Sales Results During the Quarter, 679,599 carats were sold for total proceeds of $69.4 million ( US$50.8 million ), resulting in an average price of $102 per carat ( US$75 per carat). These results compare to Q3 2023 when 478,653 carats were sold for total proceeds of $60 .2 million ( US$45.3 million ), resulting in an average price of $126 per carat ( US$95 per carat). Mark Wall , the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Q3 was again a positive quarter for the metric of tonnes treated with another robust performance in the processing plant, with grade also performing slightly better than plan. Q3 and Q4 were planned to have a lower grade than the first half of the year due to a higher percentage of lower grade Tuzo ore in the process mix. On the mining side the Hearne pit bottom mining is well progressed, and the open pit mining of Hearne will finish during Q4 of this year. The mining of the lower portions of the 5034 pit is also progressing, with some geotechnical challenges and higher than expected rainfall events slowing down mining, in some areas. The work to strip down to the NEX orebody has started with this pit expected to be a significant contributor to production in the second half of 2025. Work to sequence the plan between the finish of the 5034 pit and waste stripping to the NEX orebody remains in progress. 2024 Production guidance of 4.2 - 4.7 million carats recovered is maintained, with production currently expected to finish in the mid to upper portion of the guidance range. Total tonnes mined is expected to finish lower than the bottom of guidance of 36 million tonnes, with ore tonnes mined expected to finish above the top of guidance of 4.6 million ore tonnes and ore tonnes treated close to the upper end of guidance.\" Reid Mackie , Vice President of Diamond Sales and Marketing, commented: \"The rough diamond market during Q3 was unsettled by continued price decreases announced by leading polished diamond price indices. This was compounded by reports of delayed polished buying by downstream retailers and precipitated sales of polished stock by the industry midstream. Many rough producers addressed this by cancelling or delaying their rough diamond sales during the third quarter. For Mountain Province , which held its usual two scheduled sales during the quarter, prices achieved were largely stable. We look forward to the upcoming holiday season demonstrating demand for diamond jewellery at retail and firming up rough diamond market sentiment.\" Earnings Release and Conference Call Details The Company will host its quarterly conference call on Thursday November 7 th , 2024, at 11:00am ET .
